<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>


<p>It is now about twelve months since, that my
attention was first attracted to the <span class="smcap">Eastern Bath</span>.
I thought I knew as much of baths as most men:
I knew the hot, the warm, the tepid, and the cold;
the vapour, the air, the gaseous, the medicated, and
the mud bath; the natural and the artificial; the
shower, the firework, the needle, the douche, and
the wave bath; the fresh-river bath and the salt-sea
bath, and many more beside: I knew their
slender virtues, and their stout fallacies; they had
my regard, but not my confidence; and I was not
disposed to yield easily to any reputed advantages
that might be represented to me in favour of baths.
Mr. Urquhart talked to me, but without producing
any other than a passing impression; he had, many
years before, illustrated, under my observation, the
beneficial effects of heat and moisture on his own
person; but it bore no fruits in me; for where could
I find another man who would submit to a process of
so much severity? Without being prejudiced against
the whole family of baths, I was not to be enticed
into any belief or trust in them, without some posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>tive
and undoubted proof. Such was the state of
my opinion with regard to baths, when an earnest
man, with truth flashing from his eyes, one day
stood before me, and challenged me to the trial of
the Eastern Bath. I would, if no engagement
occurred to prevent me. "Let nothing stand in your
way, for there are few things of common life of more
importance!" was the appeal of my visitor. "On
Saturday, at four o'clock?" "So be it." And on
Saturday, at four o'clock, with the punctuality of
Nelson, I stood in Mr. George Witt's Thermæ.</p>

<p>To George Witt, F.R.S., the metropolis is indebted
for a knowledge of the Eastern Bath. Mr.
Urquhart struck the spark in "The Pillars of
Hercules;" Dr. Barter caught it in Ireland, and
fanned it into a blaze; another spark was attracted
by Mr. George Crawshay and Sir John Fife, and
burst into a flame in Newcastle-on-Tyne and the
North of England. Mr. Urquhart himself applied
the match in Lancashire; but Mr. George Witt
introduced the Bath to London and its mighty ones.
Rank, intellect, learning, art, all met, as companions
of the new "order of the Bath," in Prince's
Terrace, Hyde Park. And all will remember, with
kindness and affection, the generous disinterestedness
and earnest truthfulness of their host.</p>

<p>When I stepped into the Calidarium for the first
time; when I experienced the soothing warmth of
the atmosphere; when, afterwards, I perceived the
gradual thaw of the rigid frame, the softening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the flesh, the moistening of the skin, the rest of the
stretched cords of the nervous system, the abatement
of aches and pains, the removal of fatigue, and
the calm flow of imagination and thought,&mdash;I understood
the meaning of my friend's zeal, and I discovered
that there was one Bath that deserved to
be set apart from the rest&mdash;that deserved, indeed, a
careful study and investigation.</p>

<p>The Bath that cleanses the inward as well as the
outward man, that is applicable to every age, that is
adapted to make health healthier, and alleviate
disease whatever its stage or severity, deserves to
be regarded as a national institution, and merits
the advocacy of all men, and particularly of medical
men; of those whose special duty it is to teach how
health may be preserved, how disease may be
averted. My own advocacy of the Bath is directed
mainly to its adoption as a social custom, as a
cleanly habit; and, on this ground, I would press it
upon the attention of every thinking man. But, if,
besides bestowing physical purity and enjoyment, it
tend to preserve health, to prevent disease, and
even to cure disease, the votary of the Bath will
receive a double reward.</p>

<p>Having, in my own person, and in the experience
afforded me by its regular use, become convinced of
the power and importance of the Bath, I felt it to
be a duty to make my impressions known to the
Medical Profession. With this object I addressed an
essay, entitled, "Thermo-therapeia, the Heat-cure,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
to the British Medical Association, at their meeting
at Torquay in August, 1860. In this paper, I
urged upon the members of the medical profession,
particularly in the provinces and rural
districts, to erect a bath for themselves, as an
auxiliary armament against disease, as an addition
to their pharmacopœia; and to give their support to
the establishment in every village and hamlet in
Britain of an Eastern Bath.</p>

<p>In September, 1860, I was invited to address a
paper on the "Revival of the Eastern Bath, and its
Application to the Purposes of Health," to the
National Association for the Promotion of Social
Science, at their meeting in Glasgow; an abstract
of that paper will be found in the second chapter of
this treatise. And, having subsequently been called
upon to deliver a popular lecture at the Parochial
Institution of Richmond, I penned the historical
account of the Bath which is embodied in the first
chapter. This explanation I hope my readers will
accept as accounting for a certain degree of repetition
which occurs in this volume; and which,
without the devotion of more time to the labour
than I have at my disposal, could not be avoided.</p>

<p>It will be guessed, and with truth, that I am no
longer a sceptic of the value of the Bath, when the
Bath embraces the virtues which are possessed by
the Eastern Bath. That it is a source of much
enjoyment may be inferred from the suddenness with
which it has spread through the metropolis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
London. Turkish Baths meet our eye in almost
every quarter of the town, and three Companies
have been formed, or are in course of formation,
for the establishment of Eastern Baths on correct
principles. One of these Companies, under the presidency
of Mr. Stewart Rolland, professes to draw its
inspiration directly from Constantinople, and will
take, as its especial model, the Turkish Bath.</p>

<p>When adopted as a social custom, the Turkish
model is clearly that which ought to be imitated,
on account of the moderate temperature which
belongs to it. The higher temperatures are upon
their trial; they are not a necessity of the process,
they may have their uses in disease; but it would
be best to treat them with caution, or, as a medicine,
leave them wholly in medical hands. The Bath for
the public should be one that they may adopt with
as much safety as the basin of water with which
they wash their hands.</p>

<p>The use of an elevated temperature is founded
on the well-known power of heat of destroying
organic impurity&mdash;such as odour, miasma, and animal
poison. But, in this acceptation, when applied to
the human body, it becomes a medicine of the most
potent kind; and should, therefore, be left to medical
management.</p>

<p>The Bath is an animal instinct: and, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>,
a human instinct; it is as much a necessity of our
nature as drink. We drink because we thirst&mdash;an
<em>interior sense</em>. We bathe because water, the
material of drink, is a desire of the outward man&mdash;an
<em>exterior sense</em>. An animal, whether beast or
bird, pasturing or straying near a limpid stream,
first satisfies the inward sense, and then delights
the outward sense. A man, be he savage or
civilized, can no more resist the gratification of
bathing his wearied limbs in a warm transparent
pool than he can resist the cup of water when
athirst. Instinct bids him bathe and be clean. To
inquire&mdash;Who invented the act of drinking?
would be as reasonable as to ask&mdash;Who invented
the bath?</p>

<p>The bath is coeval with the earliest existence of
man. Can it be doubted that our first parents
bathed their newly-created limbs in the river that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
"went out of Eden to water the garden"? History
teaches us, that the Phœnicians and ancient Greeks
of all ranks, from the daughters of their kings
down to the poorest citizens, were wont to bathe in
rivers and in the sea, for the purpose of cleansing
their bodies and refreshing and invigorating their
frames. They had recourse to the bath when they
ceased from sorrow and mourning, after great
fatigues of whatever kind, before and during their
meals, and at the conclusion of their battles.
Bathing was the first act of their lives, and it was
a part of their funereal rites. The birth of
Jupiter, the Thunderer, is celebrated by the poet
Callimachus in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"As soon as you were born and saw the light,</div>
      <div class="verse">Your mother's grateful burden and delight,</div>
      <div class="verse">She sought for some <em>clear brook</em> to purify</div>
      <div class="verse">The body of so dear a progeny."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, of Alcestis, when about to lay down her
life for her husband Admetus, it is written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"The pious dame, before the fatal day</div>
      <div class="verse">Of her own exit, bathed her beauteous limbs</div>
      <div class="verse">In <em>gentle rivulet</em>."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Plato, also, records how the good old philosopher
Socrates, before he drank the fatal cup of hemlock
that was to consign him to Hades, <em>bathed</em> and <em>washed</em>
himself, that he might save the women, whose duty
it was, their troublesome office.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>A short stage in the history of the bath leads us
to the discovery of springs of hot water, hot
vapour, and hot air; and these very possibly suggested
to man's inventive mind the means of procuring
so great a luxury by his own contrivance.
Homer commends one of the sources of the Scamander
for its warmth, and tells us how Andromache,
with matronly care, prepared a hot bath
for her husband Hector, against his return from
battle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Her fair-haired handmaids heat the brazen urn,</div>
      <div class="verse">The <span class="smcap">Bath</span> preparing for her lord's return."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We are taught also that Vulcan, or, as others
say, Minerva, discovered certain <em>hot baths</em> ([Greek: Hêrakleea
loutra]) to Hercules, that he might replenish his
strength after undergoing severe exertion and
fatigue. And the Phœdrians, according to Homer,
laid great stress upon the importance to the health
and happiness of man of frequent changes of
apparel, comfortable beds, and <em>hot baths</em>.</p>

<p>It is one of the marvels of the earth's history,
that hot springs, or thermal springs, bubble upwards
to the light, not only on Mount Ida, the
source of the Scamander, but in countless other
places and countries on the world's surface. These
hot springs would appear to have invited man to
their use by their pleasant aspect and by their
warmth; and their enjoyment to have suggested
the possibility of contriving artificially a similar
luxury nearer to his threshold.</p>

The word Hamâm, which is equivalent to thermal
springs, is not unfrequently met with in the
East as the name of a town or village in or near to
which hot springs are found. Hamâm Ali, in the
neighbourhood of ancient Nineveh, is an example
of this kind. "The thermal spring is covered by a
building, only commodious for half-savage people,
yet the place is much frequented by persons of the
better classes both from Baghdad and Mósul."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Captain Kennedy, in his "Travels in Algeria and
Tunis," tells us of the hot springs of Hamâm
Meskhoutin, which rise to the surface at a temperature
of 203° of Fahrenheit, only 9° short of
boiling, and are so abundant as to burst forth
through any opening made accidentally in the
ground. "The thermal waters, in flowing over the
bank of the rivulet, have formed a calcareous
deposit of great beauty, resembling a cascade of
the purest white marble, tinged here and there
with various shades of green and orange."</p>

<p>In Italy, near the town of Pozzuoli, are some
natural thermal springs&mdash;the ancient Posidianæ,
now called the Baths of Nero, of which the temperature
of the water is 185°, while that of the
vapour which rises from it is 122°. The spring is
situated in a rocky cavern at the end of a long
passage formed by a fissure in the rock, and in this
way constitutes a natural bathing house.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>In Germany, among others, are the thermal springs
of Borcette, with a temperature of 171°; Carlsbad,
in Bohemia, 165°; Wiesbaden, Ems, and Schlangenbad,
in Nassau; Baden-Baden; Aix-la-Chapelle;
Wildbad; and Ischl.</p>

<p>In Iceland are the far-famed Geysers; in the
Southern Ocean the hot springs of Amsterdam
Island; and many more are dispersed over the
Continent of America; while in England there
are the thermal springs of Bath, Bristol, Buxton,
and Matlock.</p>

<p>The <em>heated rock</em> and the <em>vaporization of water</em>
would seem to have originated the primitive idea
of a hot-air and hot-vapour bath; and this idea we
find carried out simultaneously in various parts of
the world and amongst the rudest nations. Mr.
Gent, in his "History of Virginia," describes the hot-vapour
bath as employed by the American Indians.</p>

<p>"The doctor," he says, "takes three or four large
stones, which, after having heated red-hot, he places
in the middle of the stove, laying on them some of
the inner bark of oak, beaten in a mortar, to keep
them from burning; this being done, they (the
Indians) creep in, six or eight at a time, or as many
as the place will hold, and then close up the mouth
of the stove, which is usually made like an oven in
some bank near the water-side; in the meanwhile,
the doctor, to raise a steam, after they have been
stewing a little time, pours cold water on the stones,
and now and then sprinkles the men to keep them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
from fainting; after they have sweat as long as
they can well endure it, they sally out, and (though
it be in the depth of winter) forthwith plunge themselves
over head and ears in cold water, which instantly
closes up the pores and preserves them from
taking cold." After the bath, they are anointed like
the Romans, the pomatum of the Indians being for
the most part bear's-grease, containing a powder
obtained by grinding the root of the yellow
alkanet.</p>

<p>But we find this primitive form of bath nearer
home than the American Continent&mdash;namely, in
Ireland, although both the American and the Irish
bath may, Mr. Urquhart suggests, have been
derived from the same ancestry&mdash;that of the
Phœnicians. In a foot-note appended to a page on
the universality of the bath, in his "Pillars of
Hercules,"<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Mr. Urquhart gives the following very
curious and very interesting account of the practice
of sweating employed in former times in Ireland,
as reported to him by a lady as a recollection of
her childhood:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With respect to the sweating-houses, as they
are called, I remember about forty years ago seeing
one in the island of Rathlin, and shall try to give
you a description of it. It was built of basalt
stones, very much in the shape of a bee-hive, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>a row of stones inside, for the person to sit on when
undergoing the operation. There was a hole at the
top, and one near the ground, where the person
crept in and seated him or herself, the stones having
been heated in the same way as an oven for baking
bread is, the hole on the top being covered with a
sod while being heated, but I suppose removed to
admit the person to breathe. Before entering, the
patient was stripped quite naked, and on coming
out, dressed again in the open air. The process
was reckoned a sovereign cure for rheumatism and
all sorts of pains and aches."</p>

<p>Dr. Haughton on the same subject remarks that:&mdash;"Two
varieties of <em>Tig Allui</em>, or sweating-houses,
exist in Ireland, one kind being capable of containing
a good many persons, and the other only
intended for a single occupant." The former is that
just described: it is heated in the same way as an
oven, by making a large fire of wood in the middle
of the floor, and after the wood is burnt out,
sweeping away the ashes. Besides the cure of
rheumatism, the young girls who have tarnished
their complexion in the process of burning kelp or
sea-weed for the manufacture of soda, also resort
to the Tig Allui for the purpose of clearing their
skin. The usual time for remaining in the bath is
under the half hour.</p>

<p>The second kind of Tig Allui&mdash;namely, that for
the reception of a single person only&mdash;is described
by Dr. Tucker, of Sligo, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is built of stone and mortar, and brought to
a round top. It is sufficiently large for one person
to sit on a chair inside, the door being merely large
enough to admit a person on his hands and knees.
When any of the old people of the neighbourhood,
men or women, are seized with pains, they at once
have recourse to the sweat-house, which is brought
to the proper temperature by placing therein a large
turf fire, after the manner of an oven, which is left
until it is burned quite down, the door being a flat
stone and air-tight, and the roof, or outside of the
house, being covered with clay, to the depth of about
a foot, to prevent the least escape of heat. When
the remains of the fire are taken out, the floor is
strewn with green rushes, and the person to be
cured is escorted to the bath by a second person
carrying a pair of blankets. The invalid, having
crept in, plants himself or herself in a chair, and
there remains until the perspiration rolls off in large
drops. When sufficiently operated on, he or she,
as the case may be, is anxious to get out, and the
person in waiting swaddles him up in the blankets,
and off home, and then to bed. I have heard old
people say that they would not have been alive,
twenty years ago, only for the sweating-house....
Remains of the Tig Allui are also found in the
county Tyrone, of the following dimensions:&mdash;five
feet in height, nine in length, and four in width,
being built of solid masonry, and shaped like a bee-hive
at the top."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Another, and a very important step in the progress
of the bath was the contrivance of a mode of
heating by means of which the temperature might
be made uniform, and might be regulated in any
manner that should be required. The hot stones
of the North American medicine-man were clearly a
very bungling and uncertain expedient; little better
than the warm skin of a newly-killed animal; and
the wood fire of the Irish sweating-houses was more
objectionable still, not only on account of the impossibility
of regulating the heat, but also from the
resulting impurity of the atmosphere and the danger
of leaving fragments of the heated ashes on the
floor. The next contrivance, and that which has
continued to be the practice up to the present day,
was the construction of a furnace under the floor&mdash;in
other words, a <em>hypocaust</em>. Mr. Urquhart, speaking
of the existence of baths among the Mexicans
and their probable introduction by the Phœnicians,
remarks:&mdash;"However magnificent their public
monuments," their baths were "such as are found in
almost every house in Morocco,&mdash;a small apartment
seven feet square, with a cupola roof five to six feet
high, and a slightly convex floor, under one side of
which there is a fire, and a small low door to creep
in by."</p>

<p>Reviewing the probable rise and progress of the
bath, there seems little doubt that the bath took
its origin in the East, the dwelling-place of our first
parents, the birth-place of civilization and know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>ledge.
It was known at a very early period in
Phœnicia. Mr. Urquhart, in his recent work,
"The Lebanon,"<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> relates his discovery of a Phœnician
temple, or crypt, among the ruins of Baalbeck,
or Baalbeth, <em>the House of Baal</em>&mdash;the Heliopolis, or
<em>City of the Sun</em>, of the Greeks; in which were traces
of the existence of the bath. "But the Phœnician
crypt was not my only discovery. In a gap opening
a few feet into the masonry, I found mortar
hard as stone where exposed to the air, but soft
within. Yet it was unlike other mortar; it was dark
grey, with particles of charcoal; when I brought
out some, it was recognised at once, and called
<em>kissermil</em>, or ashes from the bath. Those ashes are
still used in this country for mortar, which with
this addition becomes as hard as stone. According
to the old construction, the baths were heated
as an oven is, brushwood and dung being used as
well as wood. The combustion not being complete,
there remain various chemical compounds, alkali,
ammonia, sulphate and carbonate of lime, and carbon,
which by entering into new combinations,
bind the mortar into a distinct substance."</p>

<p>"One thing is clear, there were baths at Baalbeck.
In the elaborately finished bath of Emir
Beshir at Ibtedeen, one peculiarity struck me as
evidencing their high antiquity in this land. It
was the absence of cocks; instead of which simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>plugs or clots of cloth were used for the pipes which
brought the water into the basins. As the Romans
and Greeks used cocks, the art of the bath had not
been derived from them, but traced beyond them.
Still it was curious to observe these ashes in the midst
of Cyclopic blocks. And yet why should not the bath
have belonged to the very earliest period of human
society? It is sufficiently excellent to be from the
beginning."</p>

<p>"I remembered that in opening up the pavement
of an ancient bath on the western coast of Africa,
I had come upon a somewhat similar deposit, in
large quantities, under the floor. This was <em>gazul</em>,
the product of a certain mountain in Morocco, resembling
soapstone, but composed of an admixture
of silex, alumina, magnesia, and lime, and which
has the peculiar property of polishing the skin
when rubbed upon it, and so cleaning off the dead
epidermis. Being used for this purpose largely in
the baths, the grey deposit under the ruin in question
is easily accounted for. Might not this same
<em>gazul</em>, mixed with kissermil, have been the deposit
which I took for mortar at Baalbeck?"</p>

<p>For the purpose of removing the dead epidermis
from the surface of the skin, "four processes have
been adopted throughout the families of the human
race, and in successive times. The simple, the
natural, the first hit upon, was the rubbing down
with the ball of the hand, which is still the process
used in this country for currying horses of high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
breed. The three others, of a more refined and, I
may say, historical character, are, scraping, rolling,
and polishing. The scraping is with the <em>strigil</em>,
which we know of from the Romans and Greeks, but
which is figured on the tombs of Lycia, and the
Roman name of which is derived from Mauritania.
The rolling is that which we see to-day practised
by the Turks. The polishing is with the <em>gazul</em>,
and practised by the Moors, to whom it is confined,
and who alone possess the admirable substance
which is used for it. Now, if <em>gazul</em> was used by
the early inhabitants of Baalbeck, their bathing
process belonged to the last of these systems, and
they carried on a traffic with Morocco."</p>

<p>From Phœnicia, from the coast of Tyre and
Sidon, a knowledge of the bath may have spread
along the southern coast of the Mediterranean,
through Egypt, Tripoli, and Algiers, to Morocco
and the Pillars of Hercules; or it may, as Mr.
Urquhart suggests, have been earliest in use among
the nations of Mauritania, and have been carried by
the Moors into the countries of the East. From
Phœnicia, the knowledge of the bath may have followed
the line of caravan communication into
Russia, Persia, China, and Hindostan; while the
ships of the then greatest maritime country in the
world would have carried it to Greece, to Ireland,
and to America. The bath is a common practice
in Russia; it is also well known in Persia, Hindostan,
and China; and, as we have already seen, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
use in North America, in Mexico, and Ireland, probably
dates back to a very early age. Its progress
in Europe we shall presently see.</p>

<p>Speaking of the mode of heating the bath in
Mexico and Morocco, I have used the word hypocaust;
this word is of Greek origin, and signifies
<em>under-fire</em>&mdash;that is, the fire is placed under the thing
to be heated; for example, under the foundation
of the bath or of the house. The Greeks and the
Romans had no other means of heating their houses
than this; there was no open fire, but a fire under
the foundation, from which flues were carried upwards
in the walls of the building. When a great
heat was required, as in the baths, the foundation
was supported on short columns (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilæ</i>), and the entire
space between the columns was occupied with
fire, while numerous ascending flues distributed the
heat around the rooms. Now it is curious to find
that at the present hour the Chinese continue the
same means of heating their houses.</p>

<p>That they also employ the sudatory process of
bathing, is shown by the following extract from Mr.
Henry Ellis's "Journal of an Embassy to China,"
published in 1817:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Near this temple (at Nankin) is a public
vapour bath, called, or rather miscalled, the Bath
of Fragrant Water, where dirty Chinese may be
stewed clean for ten chens, or three farthings; the
bath is a small room of one hundred feet area,
divided into four compartments, and paved with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
coarse marble; the heat is considerable, and as the
number admitted into the bath has no limit but
the capacity of the area, the stench is excessive;
altogether, I thought it the most disgusting cleansing
apparatus<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I had ever seen, and worthy of this
nasty nation."</p>


<p>The Baths of Greece are celebrated for their
magnificence; they formed parts of buildings of
vast extent and grandeur, termed Gymnasia. The
gymnasium was an institution of the Spartans of
Lacedæmonia or Laconia, and spread thence to other
parts of Greece, and notably to the metropolis of
Attica, the famed city, Athens. The gymnasium
was sufficiently large to accommodate several thousands
of persons, and afforded space for the assembly
of philosophers, men of science, and poets, who delivered
lectures to their scholars and recited their
verses; and for the pursuit of the favourite games
and exercises of their youths and men&mdash;namely,
leaping, running, throwing the disc or quoit, and
wrestling; the purpose of these exercises being to
give strength to the people and make them accomplished
warriors.</p>

<p>The different parts of a gymnasium or palæstra,
were as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Porticos</span>, in which were numerous rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
furnished with seats for the professors and their
scholars.</p>


<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Ephebeum</span>, a large space in which the
ephebi or youths planned and practised their
exercises.</p>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Apodyterium</span>, or undressing room; also
called Gymnasterium, or the room for becoming
nude.</p>

<p>4. The <span class="smcap">Elaiothesium</span>, or anointing room, which
was equally used by those who were preparing for
exercise, and those who had completed their bath.</p>

<p>5. The <span class="smcap">Konisterium</span>, or dusting room, where the
bodies of the wrestlers and other athletæ, after being
anointed, were well dusted over; probably as a
defence to the skin against injury.</p>

<p>6. The <span class="smcap">Palæstra</span>, or wrestling courts, which
were bedded with sand more or less deep, like
the modern circus, in order to break the fall of
the combatants when they were thrown to the
ground.</p>

<p>7. The <span class="smcap">Sphæristerium</span>, or court for ball exercise
and raquets.</p>

<p>8. The <span class="smcap">Peristyle</span>, or <span class="smcap">Piazza</span>, within which was
the area of the Peristyle, for walking, and the exercises
of leaping, quoits, ball, and wrestling.</p>

<p>9. Then there were <span class="smcap">Xysti</span>, or covered courts, for
the use of the wrestlers in bad weather; <span class="smcap">Xysta</span>,
which were walks between walls open at the top
and intended for hot weather; and a <span class="smcap">Xystic
Sylvis</span>, or forest; the intervals of the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
ornamental columns of the building being so called,
and being devoted to walking exercise.</p>

<p>10. Next came the <span class="smcap">Baths</span>, which were hot, cold,
and tepid water baths; and a stove, or Laconicum,
named after the city of Laconia and the Lacedæmonians,
from whom the Athenians derived their
knowledge of the hot-air bath.</p>

<p>11. And lastly, there was the <span class="smcap">Stadium</span>, a segment
of an ellipse, which received its name from
being one hundred paces long, equal to six hundred
feet, or something less than an eighth of a mile.
The Stadium was furnished with rows of seats for
spectators, and was intended for the exhibition of
feats of running and exercises upon a large scale.</p>

<p>The most remarkable Stadium known was one
erected by Lycurgus on the banks of the river
Ilissus. It was built of Pentellick marble, and was
so magnificent a structure, that Pausanias the historian,
in describing it, informs his readers that
they would not believe what he was about to tell
them, "it being a wonder to all that beheld it, and
of that stupendous bigness that one would judge
it a mountain of white marble."</p>

<p>There were several gymnasia in Athens, the
most noteworthy being, the Lyceum, the Academia,
and the Cynosarges.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lyceum</span>, founded on the banks of the river
Ilissus, was consecrated to Apollo; and not without
reason, says Plutarch, but upon a good and
rational account, since from the same deity that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
cures our diseases and restores our health, we may
reasonably expect strength and ability to contend
in our exercises. The Lyceum is also interesting
to us as being the institution in which Aristotle
taught philosophy. Aristotle was wont to lecture
to his scholars while walking, and his disciples
were therefore called Peripatetics; he continued his
teaching daily until the hour of anointing, which,
with the Greeks, was a preparation for dinner.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Academia</span> was situated in the suburbs of
the city, on a piece of ground that had been reclaimed
from the marsh by draining and planting.
It was called after an old hero named Academicus.
Plutarch informs us that it was beset with shady
woods and solitary walks fit for study and meditation;
in witness whereof another writer says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In Academus' shady walks;"</p>
</div>

<p>and Horace writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In Hecademus' groves to search the truth."</p>
</div>

<p>Plato taught philosophy in the Academia; but having
in consequence of the unhealthy nature of the soil
caught the ague, he was advised to relinquish it
for the Lyceum. "No!" said the old man, "I prefer
the Academy, for that it keeps the body under,
lest by too much health it should become rebellious,
and more difficult to be governed by the dictates
of reason; as men prune vines when they spread
too far, and lop off the branches that grow too
luxuriant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cynosarges</span> was also in the suburbs of
Athens, not far distant from the Lyceum. It was
dedicated to the god of strength, Hercules; and
was interesting from its admission of strangers,
and half-blood Athenians. Its name is derived
from the circumstance of a white dog seizing upon
a part of the victim that was being sacrificed to
Hercules by Diomus; and was the origin of the
sect of philosophers known as the "Cynics."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Baths of Rome.</span>&mdash;When Greece was subjugated
by the Romans, the Romans carried back with
them to Italy the taste for the bath. They erected
thermæ of great magnificence, and in so great
number, that at one period there were nearly nine
hundred public baths in Rome. Agrippa alone is
said to have built one hundred and sixty, while
Mecænas has the credit of possessing the first private
bath. The most famed of the public baths
were those of Titus, Paulus Æmilius, Diocletian,
Caracalla, and Agrippa. In these baths was centred
all that was most perfect in material, elaborate
in workmanship, elegant in design, and beautiful
in art. Nothing was thought too grand or
too magnificent for their decoration. Superb marbles
brought from the most distant parts of the
world; the choicest selections from the riches of
their conquests, the curious and wonderful in nature
and in art; precious gems and metals; and
the finest works of the painter and the sculptor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
That beautiful production of the sculptor's art, the
Laocoon, was discovered among the ruins of the
Baths of Titus, and the celebrated Farnese Hercules
in those of Caracalla.</p>

<p>The Baths of Agrippa were constructed of brick
coated with enamel. Those of Nero were supplied
with water from the sea, as well as fresh water.
The Baths of Caracalla were a mile in circumference;
they possessed two hundred marble
columns, sixteen hundred seats of marble, and were
capable of accommodating nearly two thousand
persons; while those of Diocletian surpassed all
others in grandeur, and occupied 140,000 men for
many years in their construction.</p>

<p>Within the bath was collected all that contributed
to the enjoyment, the luxury, and the gaiety
of existence of the Romans. Here they practised
their games, their athletic sports; here they came
to learn the news of the day, to listen to recitations
of poetry and prose,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to hear the eloquent
harangues of their orators, and to be entranced
with the chords of melodious music. There were
temples devoted to dancing, to refreshment, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>bath; and in their abundant gratitude they raised
up appropriate statues to the gods who were supposed
to preside over their several enjoyments.
The great hall of their bath was ornamented with
the statues of Hercules, the god of strength;
Hygeia, the goddess of health; and Æsculapius,
the god of medicine.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at, that, reared in the
midst of the luxury, in the enjoyment of their
Balneæ or Thermæ, the Romans should have carried
with them their longing for the bath wheresoever
they went, wheresoever their victorious armies
forced themselves a way; and that, possessing a
mastery over England and Wales, which they
maintained for nearly four hundred years, they
should have founded baths in their chief settlements
in this country. Thus we have remains
of Roman baths in London, in Chester, in Bath, at
Wroxeter (Uriconium) in the neighbourhood of
Shrewsbury, at Cirencester (Corinium), at Carisbrooke,
in Colchester (Camulodunum), and in
several other places besides.</p>

<p>But here we are compelled to draw a line of
distinction between those grand institutions of their
own metropolis, which comprised, as I have just described,
their places of recreation, of exercise, of
amusement, of diversion, as well as their temples
of health; which were, in fact, a centralization of
almost all the public institutions of their city into
one&mdash;and those particular parts of these insti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>tutions
which were specially devoted to health.
Although the remains of the Roman thermæ in
England are large, although their construction
evinces a great perfection in many of the arts of
social life, particularly in the manufacture of bricks
and pottery, yet they scarcely bear comparison
with the grander thermæ of ancient Rome, and
for this reason: that all that was simply ornamental&mdash;or,
if I might be permitted to say so, that
was superfluous&mdash;has been omitted, and nothing
but the substantial and the wholesome allowed to
remain&mdash;that portion, in fact, which was purely
devoted to health and strength. We thus prune
the bath down to its simpler elements, and we
prepare the way for the consideration of the
bath as it has been revived amongst us at the
present day.</p>

<p>Without some explanation, it would be difficult
to understand how an institution which was regarded
with so much veneration by ancient Rome,
should have totally fallen into decay in modern
Rome; and that the thermæ shall have ceased to
have an existence in Rome at the present day. It
is clear that the games which were once played, and
the exercises which were practised, within the narrow
limits of the thermæ, grand though they were,
have now sought a wider sphere: the paintings of
their great artists have been gathered into the
ecclesiastical edifices and academies; the statues
and sculpture have found their way into museums,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
or have been applied to the decoration of modern
palaces; refreshment is more conveniently obtained
in the cafés and restaurants; music and singing
have been transferred to the opera; recitation to
the theatre; poetry and prose to the library; and
dancing to the assemblies; nay, the great hall of
the Bath of Agrippa is now, in all its integrity, a
place of Christian worship. In a word, the thermæ
has become decentralized; whether as the result of
the adoption of foreign fashions, or as a matter of
convenience, it may be difficult to say; but so it is,
and nothing of it now remains but the bath&mdash;that
temple of the ancient thermæ over which Hercules,
and Hygeia, and Æsculapius presided of old, and
over which (in its humbler shape) they will continue
to preside to the end of time.</p>

<p>The Baths of Titus have fortunately preserved to
us a drawing, taken from its walls, which illustrates
the construction and the mode of taking the bath
among the Romans.</p>

<p>Beneath the bath is shown the furnace, or <em>hypocaustum</em>,
for heating the rooms, as also the water
used in the latter stages of the process.</p>

<p>Then follows a series of rooms, of which the principal
are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Apodyterium</span>, <span class="smcap">Gymnasterium</span>, or <span class="smcap">Vestiarium</span>:
the undressing and dressing-room.</p>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Tepidarium</span>, which is warmed to a moderate
temperature, and is intended to prepare and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
season the body before entering the hotter apartment.</p>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Caldarium</span>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calidarium</i>, sometimes
called the <span class="smcap">Sudatorium</span>, and in the figure (Fig. 2),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">concamerata sudatio</i>, was a room of higher temperature,
in which the perspiratory process was accomplished.
In this apartment there was commonly a
recess, of a higher temperature still, which was intended
for special purposes, and was named <span class="smcap">Laconicum</span>,
in compliment to the Spartans of Laconia.</p>

<p>4. After the Calidarium followed a <span class="smcap">Lavatorium</span>
(Lavatrina, Latrina), called in the figure Balneum,
in which the body was washed after the process of
perspiration was complete. The mode of washing
was to sit on the everted edge or lip of a large
marble trough&mdash;the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">labrum</i>&mdash;and to be rinsed with
warm water poured over the body by means of a
cup or small basin (<em>pelvis</em>).</p>

<p>5. The bather then went into the <span class="smcap">Frigidarium</span>,
where he received an affusion of cold water, and
where he reclined, or sat, or walked about, until he
was cool or dry.</p>

<p>6. From the Frigidarium the bather passed into
the <span class="smcap">Elaiothesium</span>, or anointing room, where he was
smeared with fragrant oils previously to resuming
his dress in the <span class="smcap">Vestiarium</span>.</p>


<p>Besides these, which were the principal rooms, there
were others devoted to additional processes, such as
shaving, hair-cutting, depilation, and hair-plucking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The Romans carried the indulgence and decoration
of their baths to so unreasonable a pitch of
luxury and extravagance as to call forth State restrictions
upon their use, and the reproof of their
philosophers. Juvenal levels a shaft of satire against
those who make the bath the instrument of gluttony;
and Pliny scolds the doctors for declaring that the
bath assists digestion, and for withholding their
denunciations against its excessive abuse. Moreover,
the Emperor Titus is said to have lost his
life through excess of the bath, having spent in it
many hours of the day. We cannot, therefore, be
surprised that the time devoted to bathing should
be limited by imperial edict, as happened in the
reign of the Emperor Hadrian, the hours when the
bath was open to the public being confined to two,&mdash;namely,
from three until five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pliny</span> the Consul, in his admirable letters, speaks
in most affectionate language of the bath. "How
stands Comum" (meaning Como, his birthplace),
says he, "that favourite scene of yours and mine?
What have you to tell me of the firm yet soft
gestatio,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the sunny bath?" In another letter, addressed
to a lady, he says:&mdash;"The elegant accommodations
which are to be found at Narnia ...
particularly the pretty bath."</p>

<p>Describing his winter villa, Laurentium, after
painting a series of rooms, he continues:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>"From thence you enter into the grand and
spacious <em>cooling-room</em> belonging to the baths, from
the opposite walls of which two round basins project,
large enough to swim in. Contiguous to this
is the perfuming-room, then the sweating-room, and
beyond that the furnace which conveys the heat to
the baths. Adjoining are two other little bathing-rooms,
which are fitted up in an elegant rather than
costly manner: annexed to this is a warm bath of
extraordinary workmanship, wherein one may swim,
and have a prospect at the same time of the sea.
Not far from hence stands the tennis-court, which
lies open to the warmth of the afternoon sun."</p>

<p>"Between the garden and this gestatio runs a
shady walk of vines, which is so soft that you
may walk barefoot upon it without any injury."</p>

<p>Alluding to the mode of life of one of his friends,
he observes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the baths are ready, which in winter is
about three o'clock, and in summer about two, he
undresses himself, and if there happens to be no
wind, he walks for some time in the sun. After
this he plays a considerable time at tennis, for by
this sort of exercise, too, he combats the effects of
old age. When he has bathed, he throws himself
upon his couch till supper<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> time."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seneca</span> reproves the extravagance and self-indul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>gence
of his countrymen in a memorable letter (his
eighty-sixth), which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I write from the very villa of Scipio Africanus,
having first invoked his manes, and that altar which
I take to be the sepulchre of so great a man.</p>

<p>"I behold a villa built of squared stone; the wall
encloses a wood, and has towers after the style of a
fortification; the reservoir lies below the buildings
and the walks, large enough for the use of an army;
the bath is close and confined, dark, after the old
fashion, for our forefathers united heat with obscurity.</p>

<p>"I was struck with an inward pleasure when I
compared these times of Scipio with our own. In
this nook did that dread of Carthage&mdash;to whom our
city owes her having been but once taken&mdash;wash his
limbs, wearied with labour; for, according to the
ancient custom, he tilled his fields himself. Under
this mean roof did he live&mdash;him did this rude pavement
sustain.</p>

<p>"But who at this time would submit to bathe thus?
A person is held to be poor and sordid, whose house
does not shine with a profusion of the most precious
materials, the marbles of Egypt being inlaid
with those of Numidia; unless the walls are ornamented
with an elaborate and variegated stucco,
after the fashion of painting; unless the chambers
are covered with glass; unless the Thasian stone,
formerly a curiosity worthy of being placed in our
temples, surrounds the pools into which we cast our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
bodies weakened with immoderate sweating; unless
the water is conveyed through silver pipes.</p>

<p>"As yet, I have confined my remarks to private
baths only. What shall I say when I come to our
public baths? What a profusion of statues. What
a number of columns do I see supporting nothing;
but placed as an ornament, merely on account of
their expense. What quantities of water murmuring
down steps. We are come to that pitch of luxury,
that we disdain to tread upon anything but
precious stones.</p>

<p>"In this Bath of Scipio are small holes rather
than windows, cut through the wall, so as to admit
the light without interfering with its resemblance
to a fortification.</p>

<p>"But now we reckon a bath fit only for moths
and vermin, whose windows are not so disposed as
to receive the rays of the sun during his whole
career; unless we are washed and sunburnt at the
same time; unless from the bathing-vessel we have
a prospect of the sea and land. In fact, that which
excited the admiration of mankind, when first built,
is now rejected as old and useless. Thus it is that
luxury finds out something new in which to obliterate
her own works.</p>

<p>"Formerly, baths were few in number, and not
much ornamented; for why should a thing of common
life be ornamented, which was invented for use,
and not for the purposes of elegance? The water in
those days was not poured down in drops like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
shower, neither did it run always as if fresh from a
hot spring; nor was its clearness considered a matter
of consequence. But, ye gods! what pleasure
was there in entering those obscure and vulgar
baths when prepared under the direction of the
Cornelii, of Cato, or of Fabius Maximus? For the
most renowned of the ædiles had, by virtue of their
office, the inspection of those places where the
people assembled, to see that they were kept clean
and of a proper and wholesome degree of temperature;
not of a heat like that of a furnace, such as
has been lately found out, proper only for the punishment
of slaves convicted of the highest misdemeanors.
We now seem to make no distinction
between being warm and burning.</p>

<p>"How many do I hear ridiculing the simplicity
of Scipio, who did not admit the day into his
sweating-places, or suffer himself to be baked in a
hot sunshine. Unhappy man! He knew not how
to enjoy life!</p>

<p>"The water he washed in was not clear and transparent,
but, after rain, even thick and muddy. This,
however, concerned him but little; he came to the
bath to refresh himself after his labour, not to
wash away the perfumes of a pomatumed body.
What think you some will say of this? I envy not
Scipio: he lived in exile indeed, who bathed in this
manner.</p>

<p>"Should you be told further, that he bathed not
every day&mdash;for those who relate to us the traditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of early times, say that our forefathers bathed their
whole bodies on market-days only&mdash;it will be answered,
Then they were very uncleanly. How, think
ye, they smelt? Like men of labour and fatigue.</p>

<p>"Since dainty baths have been invented, we are
become more nasty. Horace, when describing a man
infamous for his dissipation, what does he reproach
him with? With smelling of perfumed balls!
'Pastillos Rufillus olet.'"</p>

<p>Of the ancient Roman bath in England, we have
several examples, the most interesting being that
which has been lately brought to light in the ancient
Roman city, Uriconium, in the neighbourhood of
Shrewsbury. Uriconium is close to the village of
Uroxeter, commonly pronounced Wroxeter, five
miles from Shrewsbury. It is situated on the property
of the Duke of Cleveland, and is known to
have existed at the beginning of the second century
of the Christian era, when the Romans held dominion
over England, and when England was a
part, and a highly-treasured part, of the Roman
Empire.</p>

<p>It was of considerable size, having a boundary
wall three miles in circumference, and was, doubtless,
a flourishing city; but fell a victim to the
ravages of fire and the sword during the fifth century,
and has since lain buried and unnoticed until
the last few years, when a society was formed for
the purpose of excavating it.</p>

<p>The walls of the houses are remarkable for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
thickness, namely, three feet; while that of the
wall of the town is four feet. They are constructed
upon a plan commonly adopted by the Romans&mdash;namely,
a facing of stone on each side, and the
space between filled in with rubble and that remarkable
stone-like enduring mortar which has
suggested the name of a better kind of cement of
the present time, known as "Roman cement." The
height of the houses was thirty feet; but they had
no upper storey, and there is no trace of staircase.</p>

<p>Of the mode of warming the houses and, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par
excellence</i>, the baths, the Rev. Thomas Wright<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
observes:&mdash;"The Romans did not warm their
apartments by fires lighted in them.... The floor
of the house, formed of a considerable thickness of
cement, was laid upon a number of short pillars
formed usually of square Roman tiles placed one
upon another, and from two to three feet high.
Those of the largest hypocausts yet found at Wroxeter
were rather more than three feet high. Sometimes
these supports were of stone, and in one or
two cases in discoveries made in this country they
were round. They were placed near to each other
and in rows, and upon them were laid, first, larger
tiles, and over these a thick mass of cement, which
formed the floor, and upon which the tesselated
pavements were set. Sometimes small parallel
walls forming flues instead of rows of columns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>supported the floor.... Flue tiles&mdash;that is, square
tubes made of baked clay with a hole on one side
or sometimes on two sides&mdash;were placed against
the walls endways one upon another so as to run
up the walls."</p>

<p>My friend Mr. George Witt, having recently
visited the ruins of the ancient Roman bath still
existing at No. 117, Bridge-street, Chester, describes
it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The most interesting of all the Roman antiquities
of this ancient city are the remains of a
private Roman bath, showing the <em>Hypocaustum</em>, or
heating place beneath, in a state of great preservation.
The hypocaust is 18 feet long by 8 feet
wide, and 3 feet high. The roof was supported on
thirty-two stone pillars (of a single block), broader
at the base and the top, and narrower in the middle;
of these twenty-eight still remain. On the top of
the columns are placed, by way of capitals, strong
tiles from 17 to 23 inches square, and 3 inches
thick, reaching from pillar to pillar, thus forming,
at the same time, the roof of the hypocaust and the
floor of the room above. Over all these is a bed of
hard concrete, 9 or 10 inches thick, the whole
suited to bear any amount of heat. The pillars are
made of the red sandstone of the district, and are
so far worthy of note, that they differ from the tile-columns
of most of the Roman hypocausts found
in other parts of England, which are chiefly formed
of piles of 8-inch tiles, 2 inches thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"The room above the hypocaust, which was the
hot-chamber of the bath, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caldarium</i>, has
unfortunately been so dismantled, that little or
nothing can now be learned of its character or
proportions, two of the side walls only remain.
The walls of these hot-chambers are generally
on the inside by ranges of hollow flue-tiles,
coming up from the hypocaust below, varying in
number, according to the degree of heat required.</p>

<p>"There is nothing whatever here left of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frigidarium</i>, or cooling-room, nor any other of the
apartments of the bath, nor of any of the contrivances
used therein, except a sort of tank, 7 feet
deep, 10 feet long, and 4 feet wide, situate near the
mouth of the furnace, which may have served either
as a receptacle for warm water, or as a place for a
plunge in cold water, after the previous processes of
the bath had been completed.</p>

<p>"Like modern Rome, the present city of Chester
stands some feet above the level of the old Roman
city; the visitors, therefore, must be prepared to
descend into a dark cellar, to inspect the hypocaust
and so-called bath! and to emerge therefrom, with
a bitter feeling of humiliation and regret, that our
forefathers could have so ruthlessly destroyed these
interesting evidences of the manners and customs
of that wonderful people, who for upwards of four
hundred years held dominion over this island&mdash;a
people to whom we are indebted for the fundamental
principles of our social civilization; for the intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>duction
of architecture, sculpture, coinage of money,
construction of roads, and for innumerable other
arts and adornments of life. There can be no more
instructive proof of the mental darkness of those
ages which followed the overthrow of the Roman
Empire, than the wholesale destruction of the
buildings of that great people, of which this is an
example; and it is to be lamented that this barbarism,
in regard to such monuments of antiquity,
has not yet altogether disappeared."</p>

<p>And where, it may be asked, is the bath now;
the conquering Romans have ceased to be other
than a name, or a weary lesson for schoolboys; the
Romans are gone, the Roman bath is lost. But
here an eloquent modern author, Mr. Urquhart,
helps us in our difficulty with a quotation:&mdash;"A
people who know neither Latin nor Greek have
preserved this great monument of antiquity on the
soil of Europe, and present to us, who teach our
children only Latin and Greek, this Institution in
all its Roman grandeur and its Grecian taste. The
bath, when first seen by the Turks, was a practice
of their enemies, religious and political; they were
themselves the filthiest of mortals; yet no sooner
did they see the bath than they adopted it, made it
a rule of their society, a necessary adjunct to every
settlement, and Princes and Sultans endowed such
institutions for the honour of their name." This,
then, is the answer to the question&mdash;Where is the
bath now? The ancient Roman bath lives in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
modern offspring, the Turkish Bath&mdash;the Turkish
Hamâm.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we see the words "Turkish
Bath" in grand letters paraded through our metropolis;
when we see a human being performing the
part of a sandwich, with a broadsheet of Turkish
bath in front, and a similar sheet behind, himself
representing a flattened anchovy between the two
slices, we shall know that the ancient Roman bath,
after being kept alive for many centuries by the
fostering care of the Turks, has at last come back
to revisit its ancient haunts, and to offer to modern
Britons the enjoyments from which our forefathers
turned away with contempt as a custom of their
conquerors. And we are led to recognise the truth
of my preliminary proposition&mdash;that the bath is an
instinct, and that, being an instinct, its survival of
a race is no longer a wonder, but is a law of nature&mdash;a
law of the universe.</p>

<p>Let me now describe the Hamâm, or Turkish Bath
as it exists at the present moment in Constantinople;
and in this description I shall take as my
groundwork the account given of it by Mr. Urquhart.
It is a large building, with a domed roof, a square
massive body, from which minarets shoot up, and
against which wings abut containing side apartments.
The essential apartments of the hamâm are
three in number&mdash;a great hall or <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">mustaby</i>, a <em>middle
chamber</em>, and an <em>inner chamber</em>. We raise the curtain
which covers the entrance to the street, and we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
ourselves in the <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">mustaby</i>, a circular or octagonal hall,
maybe a hundred feet high, with a domed roof, and
open in the centre to the vault of heaven. In the
middle of the floor is a basin of water four feet
high, with a fountain playing in the centre, and
around it are plants and trellises; and resting
against it, at some one point, the stall whence
comes the supply of coffee and pipes or chibouques.</p>

<p>Around the circumference of the hall is a low
platform, from four to twelve feet in breadth and
three feet high. This is divided by dwarf balustrades
into small compartments, each containing one or
more couches. These compartments are the
dressing-rooms, and the couches, shaped like a
straddling letter W, and adapted by their angles to
the bends of the body, are the <em>couches of repose</em>. It
is here that the bather disrobes; his clothes are
folded and placed in a napkin, and the napkin is
carefully tied up. He then assumes the bathing
garb; a long Turkish towel (<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">peshtimal</i> or <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">futa</i>) is
wound turban-wise around his head; a second
around his hips, descending to the middle of the
leg; and a third, disposed like a scarf over one or
both shoulders. Two attendants shield him from
view while changing his linen, by holding a napkin
before him; and when he is ready, the same attendants
help him to descend from the platform;
they place wooden pattens (called <i>nalma</i> in Turkish,
and <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">cob cob</i> in Arabic) on his feet, and taking each
arm, lead him to the middle apartment. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
wooden pattens are intended to protect the feet
from the heat of the inner rooms, and from the
dirty water and slop of the passages.</p>

<p>"The slamming doors are pushed open, and you
enter the region of steam;" this is the <em>second
chamber</em>, it is low, dark, and small; it feels warm
without being hot or oppressive, and the air is
moistened with a thin vapour. It is paved with
white marble, and a marble platform eighteen inches
high occupies its two sides, while the space between
serves as the passage from the mustaby to the
inner hall. A mattress and cushion are laid on the
marble platform, and here the bather reclines; he
smokes his chibouque, sips his coffee, and converses
in subdued and measured tones with his neighbour.
This is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tepidarium</i> of the Roman bath; here
the bather courts a "natural and gentle flow of
perspiration," and to this end are adapted the warm
temperature, the bath coverings, the hot coffee, and
the tranquil rest.</p>

<p>"The bath is essentially sociable, and this is the
portion of it so appropriated; this is the time and
place where a stranger makes acquaintance with a
town or village. While so engaged, a boy kneels
at your feet and chafes them, or behind your cushion,
at times touching or tapping you on the neck, arm,
or shoulder, in a manner that causes the perspiration
to start."</p>

<p>After a while the bath attendant arrives; he
passes his hand under the linen coverings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
bather; if he find the skin sufficiently moist and
softened, the bather is again taken by the arms,
his feet are replaced in the wooden pattens, another
slamming door is opened, and he is ushered into the
<em>inner apartment</em>, "a space such as the centre dome
of a cathedral," lighted by means of "stars of
stained glass in the vault." The temperature of
this apartment, the Calidarium or Sudatorium of
the Romans, is considerably higher than that of the
middle room; the atmosphere is filled with "curling
mists of gauzy and mottled vapour," the steam
being raised by throwing water on the floor. In
the middle of the apartment is "an extensive platform
of marble slabs," and on this the bather is laid
on his back, his scarf being placed beneath him to
protect his skin from the heated marble, and the
napkin that served as his turban being rolled up as
a pillow to his head.</p>

<p>The bather is now subjected to the process of
shampooing&mdash;that is, his muscles are pressed and
squeezed, his joints are stretched until they snap,
and they are forcibly bent in various directions. In
the hands of the professional shampooer the process
is elevated to an art, and words fail to convey other
than a very imperfect idea of its nature.</p>

<p>After the shampooing, the bather is brought to
the side of the hall&mdash;around which are placed
marble basins two feet in diameter, supplied by
means of taps with hot and cold water&mdash;and made
to sit on a board near to one of these basins. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
attendant draws on a camel's-hair glove. "He
stands over you; you bend down to him, and he
commences from the nape of the neck in long sweeps
down the back till he has started the skin; he
coaxes it into rolls, keeping them in and up till
within his hand they gather volume and length; he
then successively strikes and brushes them away,
and they fall right and left as if spilt from a dish
of macaroni. The dead matter which will accumulate
in a week forms, when dry, a ball of the size of
the fist." In the course of his frictions he pours
water from the basin over the skin by means of a
copper cup, to rinse off the impurities.</p>

<p>In the next place, a large wooden bowl is placed
by the side of the bather; this bowl contains soap
and a wisp of <em>lyf</em>, the woody fibre of the Mecca
palm, and the body is thoroughly soaped and washed
twice over from the head to the feet, and, as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup
de grâce</i>, a bowl of warm water is dashed over the
entire body.</p>

<p>An attendant now approaches with warm napkins;
the hip-cloth, or cummerbund, is dropped, and a warm
dry napkin is selected to supply its place; another
is thrown over the shoulders, and the bather is placed
on a seat. The shoulder napkin is then raised, a
fresh dry one put in its place, and the first over it;
a fourth is wrapped around the head; "your feet
are already in the wooden pattens. You are wished
health; you return the salute, rise, and are conducted
by both arms to the outer hall."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>In the outer hall, the bather is led to his box;
he drops the pattens as he steps on a napkin spread
on the matting of the platform; and he stretches
his limbs on the couch of repose. "The attendants
then reappear, and gliding like noiseless shadows,
stand in a row before him. The coffee is poured
out and presented; the pipe follows; or if so disposed
he may have sherbet or fruit; the sweet or
water-melons are preferred, and they come in piles
of lumps large enough for a mouthful; and if inclined
to make a positive meal at the bath, this is
the time. The hall is open to the heavens, but
nevertheless, a boy with a fan of feathers, or a
napkin, drives the cool air upon him." The linen
is twice changed; and when the cooling is complete,
"the body has come forth shining like alabaster,
fragrant as the cistus, sleek as satin, and
soft as velvet. The touch of the skin is electric."
"The time occupied is from two to four hours, and
the operation is repeated once a week." At the
conclusion of the process, "the crispness of the skin
returns, the fountains of strength are opened: you
seek again the world and its toils; and those who
experience these effects and vicissitudes for the first
time, exclaim&mdash;'I feel as if I could leap over the
moon.'"</p>

<p>In reviewing the Turkish Bath and the process
of bathing as pursued by the Turks, we are struck
by several features which appertain especially to
it: for example, its construction of three apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>ments
only, instead of the numerous apartments of
the Romans; the three apartments being, the grand
hall, corresponding with the Frigidarium of the
Romans, and being at the same time the Apodyterium
and Vestiarium. Secondly, the presence of
vapour in the middle room, corresponding with the
Tepidarium of the Romans. Thirdly, the existence
of vapour in the third and inner room, the Calidarium
and Sudatorium of the Romans. The presence
of vapour betokens a low temperature, because
watery vapour, as is well known, is scalding
at one hundred and twenty degrees of heat; and
we have fair grounds for concluding that there was
no vapour in the Tepidarium and Caldarium of the
Romans, and that the temperature of both was
considerably higher. For Seneca, in his celebrated
letter, speaks of the importance of maintaining the
baths at a "proper and wholesome degree of temperature;
not of heat like that of a furnace, such as
has been lately found out, proper only for the punishment
of slaves convicted of the highest misdemeanors.
We now seem to make no distinction
between being warm and burning."&mdash;This criticism
would have been unnecessary had the bath contained
watery vapour, as the evil would then have
corrected itself, and the vapour, being scalding, could
not have been supported. Pliny also, speaks of the
"burning pavement of the floor" in his narrative
of an act of cruelty practised by the slaves of Largius
Macedo on their master. After beating him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and trampling upon him, they threw him on the
floor of the hot bath, and pretended that "he had
fainted away by the heat of the bath."</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of the Turkish bath relates
to one of its processes&mdash;namely, the absence of the
cold douche with which the Romans concluded their
bath. The Turks still dash cold water on the feet
when the bath is at an end; but they allow the
bather to enter the mustaby heated by the process
and still perspiring&mdash;hence the necessity of a change
of linen during the cooling, and the aid of an attendant
with a fan to cool the body. Moreover,
the process of cooling is in this way considerably
lengthened, and we can comprehend how the bath
may be prolonged to two, three, or four hours. In
the Roman method&mdash;that is, concluding with a
cold douche or a plunge in cold water&mdash;perspiration
is immediately arrested by the closing of the
pores, the body is cooled more quickly, no change
of linen is needed, no fanning is required, and the
cooling is accomplished equally well and in a shorter
space of time.</p>

<p>The process of bathing, as pursued by the Turks,
is also deserving of note. It is as follows:&mdash;Firstly,
there is the <em>seasoning of the body</em>, in the accomplishment
of which the skin becomes warm, soft,
and moist. Then follows the shampooing or manipulation
of the muscles, and stretching and playing
the joints. Next comes the rubbing up and removal
of the surface-layer of the scarf-skin. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
this succeeds soaping and rinsing; and the process
concludes with the cooling and drying of the
skin.</p>

<p>"These are the five acts of the drama." The
first scene is acted in the middle chamber, the next
three in the inner chamber, and the last in the
outer hall.</p>

<p>But that which most of all strikes us in the
Turkish bath is the order, the decorum, the tranquillity,
the dignity, the delicacy of the whole proceeding.
A screen is held before the bather while
he unrobes; his clothes are carefully folded and tied
up; before he leaves the platform, he is clad in a
becoming costume, which he retains till the end of
the process, and he is guarded by similar decencies
until he retires and quits the bath. This is the
example which all true admirers of the bath hope
to see followed in Britain: it is the Turkish bath
which we seek to emulate, not merely in its construction,
but also in its manners and management.
There is one matter, however, in which we must
fail&mdash;namely, in the multitude of attendants; but
in this particular we must learn to do what we can,
and not what we will.</p>

<p>Lady Mary Wortley Montagu has afforded us
the rare opportunity of seeing the interior of a
woman's bath in Turkey: her narrative, it is true,
relates to the practice in 1717, nearly one hundred
and fifty years back; but probably no great change
has taken place since then. The bath she visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was at St. Sophia, "famous for its hot baths, that
are resorted to for diversion and health." The
bath "is built of stone in the shape of a dome,
with no windows but in the roof, which gives light
enough. There were five of these domes joined
together, the outmost being less than the rest, and
serving only as a hall, where the portress stood at
the door.... The next room is a very large one,
paved with marble, and all round it are two raised
sofas (platforms) of marble, one above another.
There were four fountains of cold water in this
room, falling first into marble basins, and then
running on the floor in little channels made for
that purpose; ... the next room, something less
than this, with the same sort of marble sofas, but
so hot with steam ... proceeding from the baths
joining to it, it was impossible to stay there with
one's clothes on. The two other domes were the
hot baths."</p>

<p>The mustaby was already full of women, and
Lady Mary remarks on their good breeding. She
was dressed in a riding habit; "yet there was not
one of them that showed the least surprise or impertinent
curiosity, but received me with all the
obliging civility possible. I know no European
Court where the ladies would have behaved themselves
in so polite a manner to such a stranger.
I believe, upon the whole, that there were two
hundred women, and yet none of those disdainful
smiles and satirical whispers that never fail in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
assemblies when anybody appears that is not dressed
exactly in the fashion. They repeated over and
over to me, <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">Guzél, péc guzél</i>, which is nothing but
<em>Charming, very charming</em>."</p>

<p>"The first sofas"&mdash;that is, the lower platform&mdash;"were
covered with cushions and rich carpets, on
which sat the ladies; and on the second their
slaves behind them, but without any distinction of
rank by their dress, all being in the state of nature,
that is, in plain English, stark naked." There was
as little to disturb them in that state as a group
of naked children in the nursery; they had practised
the usage of the bath from their infancy, and
the idea of indelicacy would no more have crossed
their minds than it would that of Eve previously
to her temptation. "They walked and moved with
the same majestic grace which Milton describes
our general mother with. There were many amongst
them as exactly proportioned as ever any goddess
was drawn by the pencil of a Guido or Titian&mdash;and
most of their skins shiningly white, only
adorned by their beautiful hair, divided into many
tresses, hanging on their shoulders, braided either
with pearl or ribbon, perfectly representing the
figures of the Graces.</p>

<p>"I was here convinced of the truth of a reflection
I have often made, <em>that if it were the fashion
to go naked, the face would be hardly observed</em>. I
perceived that the ladies of the most delicate skins
and finest shapes had the greatest share of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
admiration, though their faces were sometimes less
beautiful than those of their companions." The
ladies were occupied "some in conversation, some
working, others drinking coffee or sherbet, and
many negligently lying on their cushions, while
their slaves (generally pretty girls of seventeen or
eighteen) were employed in braiding their hair in
several pretty fancies.... They generally take
this diversion once a week, and stay there at least
four or five hours, without getting cold by immediately
coming out of the hot bath into the
cold room, which was very surprising to me."</p>

<p>This latter remark probably explains Lady Mary's
refusal to take a bath with her companions. One
of the ladies pressed her very hard, until she was
at last forced to open her shirt and show them her
stays, which, she says, "satisfied them very well;
for, I saw, they believed I was locked up in that
machine, and that it was not in my own power to
open it, which contrivance they attributed to my
husband."</p>

<p>Lady Mary Wortley Montagu also illustrates the
extravagant decoration and expenditure that were
bestowed upon some of the private baths even in
Turkey, an extravagance that calls to mind the
baths of Rome. Speaking of a bath she visited at
Calcedonia, she observes:&mdash;"The baths, fountains,
and pavements are all of white marble, the roofs gilt,
and the walls covered with Japan china. Adjoining
to them are two rooms, the uppermost of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
is divided into a sofa, and in the four corners are
falls of water from the very roof, from shell to
shell, of white marble, to the lower end of the
room, where it falls into a large basin surrounded
with pipes that throw up the water as high as the
roof. The walls are in the nature of lattices; and
on the outside of them there are vines and woodbines
planted that form a sort of green tapestry,
and give an agreeable obscurity to those delightful
chambers."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Egyptian Bath</span> is an offshoot of the
Turkish bath; and the process, although somewhat
different, preserves the general characteristics
of its parent. Bayle St. John, in his "Village Life
in Egypt,"<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> gives us the following sketch of the
Egyptian Bath:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We went to the bath to be sweated and
scraped, and rubbed and lathered and soused, in
company with the respectabilities of Siout&mdash;brown-skinned,
hairy, rotund gentlemen, who submitted
to the operation with a gravity and sedateness at
once admirable and ludicrous. Our presence, perhaps,
put them upon stilts; but it was evident
that, as they lay like porpoises about the slushed
benches, enjoying a gentle titillation from the horny
palm of the bath servant, or submitting head,
back, and breast to the cunning razor, they felt
what important people they were&mdash;citizens of a
place which possessed a real bath, with <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">hararah</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">faskiyeh</i>, and, above all, a scalding <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">makhtas</i>&mdash;the
summum bonum of the Egyptian bather; for not
all the race of Pharaoh bathe, as not all Frenchmen
go to cafés, nor all Englishmen to clubs. From
Cairo to Siout we had not found one of these
luxurious establishments. In the antechamber,
whilst we were being kneaded as if for dough by
a coaxing lawingee, one old gentleman, who had
doubtless been soaking for hours, came and sat
down, wrapped in a sheet, opposite to us."</p>

<p>Mr. St. John fails to tell us to what extent he
appreciated the bath; but Thackeray,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> after a
similar bath at Cairo, observes:&mdash;"The after-bath
state is the most delightful condition of laziness I
ever knew, and I tried it wherever we went afterwards
on our little tour. At Smyrna the whole
business was much inferior to the method employed
in the capital. At Cairo, after the soap, you are
plunged into a sort of stone coffin, full of water
which is almost boiling.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This has its charms, but
I could not relish the Egyptian shampooing. A
hideous old blind man (but very dexterous in his
art) tried to break my back and dislocate my
shoulders, but I could not see the pleasure of the
practice; and another fellow began tickling the
soles of my feet."</p>

<p>M. Savary, in his "Letters on Egypt," published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>nearly a century back, gives a description of the
bath which is nearly identical with that of modern
writers. The first apartment, he says, is "a great
chamber in the form of a rotunda, with an open
roof," and a fountain in the centre, which plays into
a reservoir. "A spacious alcove, carpeted, is carried
round, and divided into compartments, in
which the bathers leave their clothes," and to which
they return when the bath is over. When undressed,
"sandals are put on, and a narrow passage is
entered, where the heat first begins to be felt; the
door shuts, and twenty paces further a second
opens, which is the entrance to a passage at right
angles with the first. Here the heat augments, and
those who fear to expose themselves too suddenly
to its effects, stop some time in a marble hall
(middle chamber) before they enter. The bath
itself (inner chamber) is a spacious vaulted chamber,
paved and lined with marble; beside it are four
small rooms: a vapour continually rises from a
fountain and cistern of hot water, with which the
burnt perfumes mingle."</p>

<p>His notice of the process of shampooing differs
somewhat from that of others:&mdash;"A gentle moisture
diffuses itself over the body; a servant comes,
gently presses and turns the bather, and when the
limbs are flexible, makes the joints crack without
trouble, then <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">masses</i> (touches lightly), and seems to
knead the body without giving the slightest sensation
of pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"This done, he puts on a stuff glove, and continues
rubbing long," until the skin "becomes as
smooth as satin; he then conducts the bather into
a cabinet, pours a lather of perfumed soap on the
head, and retires." "The room into which the
bather retires has two water-cocks&mdash;one for cold,
the other for hot water; and he washes himself."</p>

<p>"Being well washed and purified, the bather is
wrapped up in hot linen. Being come to the
alcove, a bed is ready prepared, on which the
person no sooner lies down, than a boy comes, and
begins to press with his delicate hands all parts of
the body, in order to dry them perfectly; the
linen is once more changed, and the boy gently rubs
the callous skin of the feet with pumice stone, then
brings a pipe and Mocha coffee."</p>

<p>M. Savary then draws the following picture of
the sensations of the bath:&mdash;"Coming from a
bath filled with hot vapour, in which excessive
perspiration bedewed every limb, into a spacious
apartment and the open air, the lungs expand and
respire at pleasure: well kneaded, and, as it were,
regenerated, the blood circulates freely, the body
feels a voluptuous ease, a flexibility till then unknown,
a lightness as if relieved from some enormous
weight, and the man almost fancies himself
newly-born and beginning first to live. A glowing
consciousness of existence diffuses itself to the very
extremities; and, while thus yielding to the most
delightful sensations, ideas of the most pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
kind pervade and fill the soul; the imagination
wanders through worlds which itself embellishes,
everywhere drawing pictures of happiness and
delight. If life be only a succession of ideas, the
vigour, the rapidity with which the memory then
retraces all the knowledge of the man would lead
us to believe that the two hours of delicious calm
which succeed bathing are an age.</p>

<p>"Such, sir, are these baths, the use of which
was so strongly recommended by the ancients, and
the pleasures of which the Egyptians still enjoy.
Here they prevent or exterminate rheumatisms,
catarrhs, and those diseases of the skin which the
want of perspiration occasions. Here they rid
themselves of those uncomfortable sensations so
common among other nations, who have not the
same regard to cleanliness."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>With the Turkish bath for our model, let us
now inquire&mdash;What the bath has been doing in
Britain? and, How a desire to restore it first came
among us? That it is among us is a fact beyond
question, and that it has spread through society
with marvellous rapidity no longer admits of
doubt. In the year 1850, Mr. Urquhart pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>lished
an interesting work in two volumes, entitled
"The Pillars of Hercules; or, a Narrative
of Travels in Spain and Morocco in 1848." In
the preface to this work occurs the following passage:&mdash;"I
have no expectation that my suggestions
will modify the lappet of a coat, or the leavening
of a loaf; but there is one subject in which I am
not without hope of having placed a profitable
habit more within the chance of adoption than it
has hitherto been&mdash;I mean the bath." In the
second volume of this work there is a chapter
(Chapter VIII.) devoted to the bath, and especially
to a description of the Turkish and Moorish
bath. It is from this source that I have drawn
the description which I have just given; and the
author refers to it in the conclusion of his seventh
chapter in these words:&mdash;"A chapter," says he,
"which, if the reader will peruse it with diligence
and apply with care, may prolong his life, fortify
his body, diminish his ailments, augment his enjoyments,
and improve his temper; then, having found
something beneficial to himself, he may be prompted
to do something to secure the like for his fellow-creatures."</p>

<p>Six years after the publication of this work&mdash;namely,
in 1856&mdash;Mr. Urquhart visited Ireland,
and made the acquaintance of Dr. Richard Barter,
the proprietor of a water-cure establishment at
Blarney. Dr. Barter, struck with the conversation
of Mr. Urquhart, and delighted with his de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>scription
of the Turkish bath, which he subsequently
read in the "Pillars of Hercules," wrote
to him as follows:&mdash;"Your description of the
Turkish bath has electrified me. If you will come
down here and superintend the erection of one,
men, money, and materials shall be at your disposal."</p>

<p>Mr. Urquhart, in his zeal for the cause, on which
he has so ably and so eloquently written, accepted
the invitation, and a month later, the foundation-stone
of the Turkish Bath of St. Anne's Hill,
Blarney&mdash;the parent of numerous baths which have
since sprung into existence in Ireland&mdash;was laid.</p>

<p>The chiefs of the pioneers of the Bath in England,
following the teachings of Mr. Urquhart, are, Mr.
George Crawshay, Sir John Fife, Mr. George Witt,
and Mr. Stewart Rolland. The first private bath
erected in England was that of Mr. Crawshay, in
1857. In the same year, Mr. Urquhart constructed
a small bath at his residence at Lytham, and the
year following commenced his elegant bath at
Riverside. Mr. Witt followed in 1858, and Mr.
Rolland in 1859. It was in Mr. Witt's bath that
I first took rank as a bather, and on that account,
as well as for its comfort and simplicity, and the
philanthropic character of its owner, Mr. Witt's
bath will always occupy a first place both in my
memory and in my heart. Let me describe it.</p>

<p>On the ground-floor of his house in Prince's
Terrace, Hyde Park, is a room twenty feet long by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ten feet in breadth, and twelve feet high, with a
window looking out upon a lead-flat. This room
he divided by a partition into two compartments,
two-thirds of the room being devoted to the purposes
of a cool-room, and the remaining third to a
hot-room. The outer room being the Mustaby or
Frigidarium; the inner room being the hot-room
of the Turkish Hamâm, the Calidarium and Sudatorium
of the Romans; there was no space for a
middle room, or Tepidarium.</p>

<p>Piercing the wall of the Calidarium near its floor
is a furnace of simple construction, opening on the
lead-flat outside, and projecting for some distance
inside into the room, where it is covered with a
casing of fire-brick; the furnace ends in a flue,
and the flue, which is one foot square, runs around
the room, close to the floor, and close also to the
wall, being separated from both the one and the
other by a space of a few inches. Having completed
the circuit of the room, the flue ascends the
angle of the apartment to the ceiling, and terminates
by opening into a chimney-shaft. The room
is heated by the radiation of caloric from the
casing of the furnace, and from the flue; and the
flue being thirty-five feet in length, presents a
radiating surface of nearly fifty yards.</p>

<p>The other features in the construction of the
Calidarium are, a wooden seat, which runs round
the room, immediately over the flue; a platform
which supports a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dureta</i>, or couch of repose; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
small tank holding ten gallons of water, kept warm
by its position against the chimney-shaft, and two
pipes which project into the room, at an elevation
of six feet and a half, for supplying warm water
from the tank, and cold water from the ordinary
house-service; add to this a double door of entrance,
a small window, and five circular holes in the wall
for ventilation, and the Calidarium is complete.</p>

<p>Let me now conduct the reader through the process
of taking a bath.</p>

<p>We enter the Frigidarium; we divest ourselves
of our clothing, which we hang on pegs fixed along
the end of the room; this is the Vestiarium, or
Apodyterium; and here we put off our shoes. We
then dress ourselves for the bath: we wind a long
strip of Turkish red twilled cotton around our hips,
in the fashion of a cummerbund or kilt; it descends
nearly to our knees; we fold another strip turban-wise
around our head; and behold! we are ready
to enter the region of heat. We need no wooden
pattens, no <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">cob cob</i>; on the clean India matting of
the Frigidarium, where shoe-leather never treads,
there is no dust; on the floor of the Calidarium
we shall find neither slop nor excessive heat; we
may press our naked sole against Mother Earth as
we would press palm to palm with our dearest
friend.</p>

<p>The question of precedence being settled, the
double door is opened, and we enter the Calidarium.
How deliciously the warm air seems to fold us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
its soft embrace; we look at the thermometer:
it is 135°. How very nice! How very agreeable!
are the expressions which we hear softly breathed
around us, for we are not alone: we are one of five
or six "Companions of the Bath." The air is clear&mdash;no
vapoury mists; it is fresh, for there is a free
circulation of air through the room; but how marvellously
soothing! All care, all anxiety, all
trouble, all memory of the external world and its
miserable littleness, is chased from the mind; our
thoughts are absorbed in rapturous contemplation
of the delights of the New World&mdash;the Paradise
into which we have just been admitted. The
tyrant <span class="smcap">Pain</span>, even, loses his miscreant power here;
the toothache, where is it gone? the headache, gone
too; the spasm no longer bides; the grinding aches
of craving appetite, the pang of neuralgia, of
rheumatism, of gout&mdash;all are fled; for this is the
region where the suffering find a soothing relief
from all their torments; and over the door is it
not written:&mdash;<span class="smcap">This is the Calidarium; pain
enters not here.</span></p>

<p>Ten minutes slip away in an enjoyment that
seems to last for a lifetime; and what is our condition
now? The skin is warm, it is soft, it is
moist, for sensible perspiration has commenced.
Those parts perspire first which have been most
exposed to the air&mdash;namely, the forehead, the head,
the neck, the chest and shoulders, because these
parts, from that very exposure, are in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
normal state. We are shortly, "like Niobe, all
tears;" but our tears are tears of bliss. Tears of
perspiration collect in beads at the apertures of the
pores; tears glide down the surface, and fall from
all the salient points of our frame, from our elbows,
from our finger-ends; a sweet languor creeps over
us, and we feel as though, like a heathen god of old,
we were dissolving into a liquid stream.</p>

<p>
"Here Fluvius wept; as now a stream declares."
</p>

<p>We experience the truth of the saying of Sanctorius,
"that melancholy is overcome by a free
perspiration, and that cheerfulness, without any
evident cause, proceeds from perspiration succeeding
well."</p>

<p>It is a curious, but at the same time an obvious
fact, with regard to perspiration, that it depends
very materially on the habit and training of the
skin. The beginner in the use of the bath perspires
slowly, languidly, partially, incompletely,
while the accustomed bather is known by the
freedom of his perspiration. The apprentice-hand
has no thirst in the bath, for a small portion only
of the excess of watery fluid is abstracted from his
tissues and from his blood. But the practised
bather has no such excess, his blood yields its
diluting water with great freedom, he thirsts in the
bath, and he drinks freely. I know a gentleman
who sometimes consumes a gallon of water in the
bath, but none remains when he comes out: all has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
been dissipated by perspiration. In a chemical
analysis of the perspiration of a group of bathers,
recently made, that fluid was found loaded with
saline and organic matter in the recruits, but was
almost pure in the veteran bather: his blood was
washed as clean as that of the working man who
eats the bread of labour&mdash;that sweetest of all bread,
the bread that has been earned with the sweat of
his brow.</p>

<p>I hardly know a more curious or more beautiful
sight than that of the healthy skin of a practised
bather, spangled over with limpid drops of perspiration
like dew-drops on the petals of a rose, or like
beads of crystal, as I heard a Doctor of Divinity
once call them, in the bath. The Reverend Doctor,
although a distinguished member of the Protestant
Church, was, as a witty friend remarked, "devoutly
counting his beads."</p>

<p>Among the labourers in hot rooms, or in proximity
with hot furnaces, as in the manufacture of
glass, enamel, porcelain, and gas, the working of
engines, and the smelting of metals, perspiration is
very profuse, and the lost fluid is replaced by the
drinking of water, or more commonly of thin gruel;
restoring the balance of fluids not by mere water,
but actually by a nutritive drink. Look at these
men, working in the open air, or in the midst of
thorough draughts, with rivers of perspiration
streaming down their athletic frames, and ask their
history; they are healthy, long-lived and happy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
In the copper-smelting works at Swansea, the heat
between the furnaces at which the men work is
200° of Fahrenheit; they drink a gallon of thin
gruel every hour, working four hours at a stretch,
and the ground on which they stand is a pool of
perspiration.</p>

<p>I have said that the temperature of Mr. Witt's
bath is 135°, and a very agreeable temperature it
is; but the temperature of the bath is a point upon
which a few observations must be made. The temperature
of the Calidarium in Mr. Urquhart's and
Mr. Rolland's bath is 170°, and is equally agreeable,
equally fresh, equally enjoyable. What then,
it may be asked, is the difference between these
baths, that renders such a wide range of temperature
equally pleasant? It is one of construction.
Mr. Witt's Calidarium is small, well ventilated for
its size, but a higher temperature than 135° or 140°
would be oppressive if more than two or three
bathers were present. Moreover, in Mr. Witt's
bath, there is an invisible vapour of water in suspension
in the atmosphere. Mr. Rolland's bath
is larger than Mr. Witt's, and the atmosphere perfectly
dry. Size of apartment and dryness of atmosphere
are therefore the opposites of restricted space
and moist atmosphere. Mr. Urquhart's bath, with
a higher temperature than Mr. Rolland's, is fresher
than either, because he has been enabled to combine
greater size, greater altitude, a fresher material,
namely, marble, moisture, and partial heating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
by means of the hypocaust. So the question of
temperature must be regarded as relative, and not
positive; a higher temperature will be fresher in a
large and well-ventilated bath with few inmates,
than a lower temperature in a small and less perfectly
ventilated apartment. Whereas, the bath
that may be fresh and agreeable in the morning
when few bathers are present, may be insufferable
in the after part of the day when a succession of
bathers has rendered the atmosphere moist, or when
many bathers are therein. The effect of many
bathers being necessarily to curtail space, infuse
moisture into the atmosphere, and deteriorate the
ventilating medium. The temperature of a bath
must therefore be specially adapted to the particular
bath; it must rise or fall with its proportions or
with its means of ventilation; it must rise or fall
with its number of bathers; it must rise in the
morning and fall in the evening. We may fix the
temperature of a hot bath, but we cannot determine
that of a Turkish bath.</p>

<p>One of the things which strikes the popular mind
the most vividly in the British Turkish bath is the
<em>high temperature</em>. When we call to mind that a hot
bath is scalding at 110°, and a vapour bath at 120°,
we are astonished to hear of a bath that is enjoyable
at 20°, 30°, and even 50° above the temperature
of scalding water. Nay, more, that can be borne
without inconvenience at <em>double</em> the temperature of
scalding water. Mr. Witt, one evening at a dinner-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>party,
explained the curious difference of action
of heat on living and dead organic matter.
A few days after, a baronet, who was one of
the party, visited Mr. Witt in his bath, and
wrote to an incredulous friend as follows:&mdash;"I
have been at Mr. Witt's bath; all that he told
us is true. I cooked a mutton-chop on my knee!
and in eating it afterwards the only inconvenience
that I experienced was in the matter of the bread&mdash;it
became toast before I could get it to my mouth."
Since I first published this anecdote, a very matter-of-fact
gentleman has written to me to say: "Well!
I can believe the mutton-chop, but is not the bread
changing to toast in its way to the mouth a little
too much for credit?" I can best answer my matter-of-fact
friend by saying, that in Mr. Urquhart's
bath at Riverside, I sat for at least ten minutes,
and without the slightest inconvenience, in his
Laconicum, at a temperature of 240°&mdash;namely, 28°
degrees above the boiling-point of water. If I had
had bread, or meat, or eggs with me, they must
necessarily have been cooked at that heat. But in
reality there is nothing wonderful in all this. I am
informed that during the Indian mutiny, the heat
in the tents was sometimes as high as 140°. Sir
Charles Blagden remained for ten minutes in a room
heated to 260°. Sir Francis Chantrey's oven, in
which his moulds were dried, and which was constantly
entered by his men, was heated to 350°.
The ovens in the slate-enamelling works of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Magnus, at Pimlico, also habitually entered by the
workmen, have a temperature of 350°. And the
oven in which Chabert, the so-called Fire King, exhibited
in London some years back, was heated to
400° and 500°.</p>

<p>We may therefore pass over the bravery of the
exceeding high temperatures as an established fact,
and not worthy of a single further remark. Man,
who would be scalded by water at a temperature of
110°, and vapour or steam at 120°, can bear for a
short time dry air at a temperature of 500° of
Fahrenheit, and upwards. But this does not so
much concern us as the question&mdash;<span class="smcap">What is the
best temperature of bath, for the purposes of
health?</span> My answer must be, a moderate temperature&mdash;a
temperature ranging in medium limits
between 120° and 140°. The Romans, who lost the
bath, used very high temperatures; the Turks, who
have preserved it, who use it to this day, have recourse,
as I have already shown, to very moderate
temperatures. For further corroboration of the
argument, let us glance at the purpose of the bath&mdash;its
intention is to <em>warm</em>, to <em>relax</em>, to induce a
<em>gentle</em>, <em>continuous</em>, and <em>prolonged perspiration</em>. It
is obvious that a gentle temperature will effect this
object more thoroughly and completely than a
burning, parching temperature of 150° and upwards.
Our purpose is not to dry up the tissues,
to rob the blood of its diluent fluid, but to soften
the callous scarf-skin that it may be peeled off, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to take away the excess of fluids pervading the economy,
and with this excess any irritant and morbid
matters which they may hold in solution.</p>

<p>But all this while I have been infringing one of
the rules of the bath; I have been talking in the
bath, and talking is of doubtful propriety; the demeanour
of the bather while in the bath must be
tranquil, composed, calm; he must give himself up
to the dissolving process without exertion of muscle
or mind; he may rub his skin gently; he may talk
gently, sententiously, like a Turk, but he must not
allow himself to become animated, and above all,
he must not be vociferous. The bath is a practice
intended for the body's health, and therefore deserves
all our consideration and respect. The rule
of Mr. Witt's bath cannot be too closely adhered to&mdash;<em>only
one talker at a time</em>&mdash;and it has the further
advantage that the talker knowing himself listened
to, takes time to think before he speaks.</p>

<p>In my experience it has rarely happened that a
novitiate has felt any inconvenience on his first entrance
into the bath. The practised bather is never
disturbed from the beginning to the end of the process.
But the beginner may, after the first quarter
of an hour, or when the perspiration is coming
forth in abundance, feel a little oppression, sometimes
a little faintness, and sometimes a little increased
action of the heart. <span class="smcap">Whenever this is
the case he should step out of the Calidarium</span>;
if there be a Tepidarium he will go into it, if not, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
may step into the Frigidarium. The uneasy feeling
soon passes away, and then he should return to the
Calidarium. He may do this as often as he likes,
and with the most perfect safety; and <em>with this hint</em>
it will be his own fault if he suffer any inconvenience
whatever. The remedy is not so simple
when, as sometimes happens, the fount of perspiration
is as yet unopened, when the bather has never
perspired, or to a very imperfect and trifling extent.
Here, of course, the relief which is afforded to the
system by perspiration is absent, and the bather
may be seriously incommoded. He must not persist;
force is antagonistic to the animal economy;
he must succumb, and essay to bring about perspiration
by the steady use of the vapour bath,&mdash;by such
a bath, in fact, as the middle room of the Turkish
bath. I know many persons who have never perspired,
to whom the luxury of the bath is consequently
lost. I know others who cannot perspire
in dry air, but can do so in vapour. How frequently
we are brought to reflect on the wisdom of
the Turks, who have added so much vapour to their
bath since they received it as an inheritance from
the Romans.</p>

<p>How long shall I continue in the bath, says Amicus?&mdash;As
long, my friend, as may be agreeable to yourself.
You do not ask me how long you shall eat,
nor how long you should sit at table. The instinct
that tells you to place your knife and fork across
your plate, must also direct you in finishing your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
bath. Something will depend, it is true, on the
temperature, and the rapidity of the process of
perspiration. If the temperature have been very
agreeable, and perspiration slow, continuous, and
efficient, you may pass the best part of an hour in
the Calidarium. If it have been too hot, and
the process untimely hurried, you must bring your
enjoyment more speedily to an end.</p>

<p>We shall suppose that our friends have enjoyed
their bath, and have agreeably spent three-quarters
of an hour in the Calidarium:&mdash;the skin is now
warm and moist, and the whole frame, its muscles
and its joints, are softened and relaxed. This is
the proper state and period, for those operations on
the muscles and joints which are called <span class="smcap">SHAMPOOING</span>.
But as the art of shampooing is unknown in this
country, or, if attempted, is practised only in the
public baths, we must be contented in our private
bath to pass over that process, the <span class="smcap">SECOND</span> of the
bath, and betake ourselves to that which follows,
the <em>rolling</em> or <em>peeling</em> of the scarf-skin.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, wholly pass by the process
of shampooing without a cursory glance at the
nature of the operation and the manner of its performance.
In the <em>inner room</em> of the Turkish bath,
we have, following the description of Mr. Urquhart,
seen the bather laid upon his back, on the marble
platform under the centre of the dome, his
mantle converted into a sheet to protect him from
the heat of the marble, and his turban placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
beneath his head in the guise of a pillow. The
shampooer, or <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">tellak</i> as he is termed&mdash;and to perform
the operation properly there should be two,&mdash;"kneels
at your side, and bending over, grips and
presses your chest, arms, and legs, passing from
part to part, like a bird shifting its place on a perch.
He brings his whole weight on you with a jerk,
follows the line of muscle with anatomical thumb,
draws the open hand strongly over the surface, particularly
round the shoulder, turning you half up
in so doing; stands with his feet on the thighs and
on the chest, and slips down the ribs; then up
again three times; and, lastly, doubling your arms
one after the other on the chest, pushes with both
hands down, beginning at the elbow, and then,
putting an arm under the back and applying his
chest to your crossed elbows, rolls on you across
till you crack. You are now turned on your face,
and, in addition to the operation above described
he works his elbow round the edges of your shoulder-blade,
and with the heel plies hard the angle of the
neck; he concludes by hauling the body half up by
each arm successively, while he stands with one
foot on the opposite thigh. You are then raised
for a moment to a sitting posture, and a contortion
given to the small of the back with the knee, and a
jerk to the neck by the two hands holding the
temples."</p>

<p>At Dar el Baida Mr. Urquhart enjoyed the
opportunity of "examining a public bath of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Moors belonging to their good times. The disposition
varies from that of the ancient Thermæ and
the modern Hamâms. The grand and noble portion
of the Turkish and the ancient bath was a
dome, open to the heavens in the centre." Such a
dome, without the opening in the centre, exists in
the Moorish bath, but it is the inner and not the
outer apartment. "The vault has deep ribs in the
fashion of a clam shell, and is supported upon columns
with horse-shoe arches spreading between. Instead
of a system of flues through the walls, only one
passed through the centre under the floor. To get
at it, I had to break through the pavement of
beaten mortar covering a slab of marble. It was
nearly filled up with a deposit, partly of soot and
partly of earthy matter, which I imagined to be the
residuum of gazul." The examination of this bath
awakened a desire to experience the process of the
bath as practised among this ancient people. There
was a bath in the house of the Governor of the
province, but the Governor was away, and it was
not until Mr. Urquhart had sustained a long religious
argument with the Caid, that he was permitted
to complete his experience. His bath
attendant and shampooer was the sub-governor;
and the occurrence was to be kept secret from the
inhabitants of the town on religious grounds. This
may explain, perhaps, the roughness of the receptions
which Mr. Urquhart met with, and the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
those refinements and comforts which commonly
belong to the Eastern bath.</p>

<p>The bather, he says, "enters the Calidarium
naked, he has no bath linen; the bath-room is
single, and placed over an oven; while a caldron
of water, heated on the fire below, throws its steam
into the apartment. The floor is burning hot; he
has no pattens; and boards are laid for him to
tread upon; the glove operation commences at
once. There was a dish of gazul for the shampooer
to rub his hands in. I was seated on the board with
my legs straight out before me; the shampooer
seated himself on the same board behind me, stretching
out his legs. He then made me close my fingers
upon the toes of his feet, by which he got a purchase
against me, and rubbing his hands in the
gazul, commenced upon the middle of my back,
with a sharp motion up and down, between beating
and rubbing, his hands working in opposite directions.
After rubbing in this way the back, he
pulled my arms through his own and through each
other, twisting me about in the most extraordinary
manner, and drawing his fingers across the region of
the diaphragm, so as to make me, a practised bather,
shriek. After rubbing in this way the skin, and
stretching at the same time the joints of my upper
body, he came and placed himself at my feet, dealing
with my legs in like manner. Then thrice
taking each leg and lifting it up, he placed his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
under the calf, and raising himself, scraped the leg
as with a rough brush, for his shaved head had the
grain downwards. The operation concluded by his
biting my heel."</p>

<p>The Moorish bath "certainly does clear off the
epidermis, work the flesh, excite the skin, set at
work the absorbent and exuding vessels, raise the
temperature, apply moisture;&mdash;but the refinements
and luxuries are wanting."</p>

<p>Captain Clark Kennedy and his friends met with
no such difficulties as those experienced by Mr.
Urquhart. After a fatiguing day's journey, they
visited a public Moorish bath at Medeah, and Captain
Kennedy records their experiences, which
show a family resemblance to the Turkish Hamâm.
Passing, he says, "through a narrow passage, we,
entered a room with two sides, occupied by a
sloping divan seven feet wide, and raised a couple
of feet from the floor." "We took off our clothes,
replaced them with a voluminous wrapper of white
cotton, and thrusting our toes into leather loops
tacked to a pair of wooden soles, shuffled along, led,
by an attendant, to a small apartment, full of steam
and tolerably warm, adjoining the bath-room.
Here we changed our drapery for dark cotton handkerchiefs,
fastened round the waist like kilts, and,
passed on into a vaulted stone chamber, lit by a
solitary lamp hanging from the roof, whose sickly,
light, struggling with the clouds of steam and the
darkness, just rendered visible the strange forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the bath attendants, naked, like ourselves, to the
waist, with a single lock of dark hair, dripping with,
moisture, dangling from each uncovered shaven
head.</p>

<p>"The pavement was flooded with hot water, and
at first the heat was so oppressive I could hardly
breathe; but the feeling went off after having been
seated for a few minutes on a stone bench in the
centre of the bath. We were now all laid out in
a row on the pavement, each stretched on a blue
cloth, with a rolled-up towel under the head, and
an operator for each person. My attendant was a
musical character, for when he commenced shampooing
he accompanied his labours with a song,
marking the chorus at the end of each verse by a
punch of extra force. Being well soaked and
softened, I was now scrubbed with a camel's-hair
glove until I felt as if I had no skin at all. I
then had my legs and arms pulled, my head screwed
round with a jerk, was then doubled up like a
boot-jack by his kneeling on my shoulders, my arms
were brought behind me, and while his knee was
forced into the hollow of my back, two or three
dexterous twists put in motion each rib and vertebra;
he then finished by endeavouring to crack,
separately, every toe and finger. A large bowl of
soap-suds was now brought, and, with a handful of
the soft fibres of the aloe, he lathered me from
head to foot. A plentiful supply of hot water was
now poured over me, and, reconducted into the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>terior,
I was enveloped in clean, white, warm linen,
a long soft towel was wrapped round my head as a
turban; and, lastly, taken into the outer room, I
was laid upon the divan with three or four sheets
over all." "The feeling of lightness and elasticity
given to a fatigued and stiffened body by a Moorish
bath cannot be imagined without being felt." "It
was too much trouble at the time to analyse my
own feelings, but I remember the predominant idea
was that I felt exceedingly comfortable." The process
lasted two hours.</p>

<p>And now a word as to the operation of shampooing.
Any inhabitant of a Northern climate
like our own must read these descriptions of the
process with wonder not unmixed with dread. Who
but a professed acrobat would venture to submit to
an operation in which a man "stands with his feet
on the thighs and on the chest, and slips (his feet)
down the ribs, then up again three times?" or
"putting an arm under the back, and applying his
chest to your crossed elbows, rolls on you across
till you crack?" I have already explained that the
operation of shampooing requires that the skin and
the whole body, especially the muscular system,
should be thoroughly softened before this process is
commenced; and it would appear that when the
proper degree of softening is attained, the Eastern
people, who are remarkable for the pliability and
elasticity of their joints, can support the operation
without inconvenience. But the Northern races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
are built for strength and endurance; their quality
is solidity, not pliability; their joints are too firmly
knit, and the bones too strongly braced together, to
permit of the application of such force as would
make the skeleton crack, without serious inconvenience
and, indeed, danger. We have but to see
the Asiatic throw his foot over his shoulder, bend
his finger upon the back of his hand, crack every
joint of the fingers with the most moderate traction,
or drop gracefully upon the ground, sitting on
the side of the foot, with the sole upturned towards
the skies, to be assured that there is something in
the structure of the bones and joints of the Asiatic
that does not exist amongst us. And if one of
these people were to tie himself up in a knot, we
should not be much surprised. We know, also, that
this curious pliability of the frame is enjoyed by
Europeans born and reared in the East; and, moreover,
that where it exists in a most perfect degree
while such persons are residing in the East, it is
considerably diminished, and even lost, on their
migration to a cold climate. There are, doubtless,
many persons amongst us who could bear the
Turkish process of shampooing, and particularly
after a sojourn of some time in the East, where the
climate alone would tend to soften their organism;
and we can comprehend how a sailor, whose special
education is pliability and ductility of body and
limb, could go through the process creditably; but
we cannot realize the same of the soldier or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
ploughman; and as little should we tolerate a
similar penance ourselves. Turkish shampooing
may continue to be practised in the Turkish
Hamâm, but the process must be considerably
modified before it can become popular in Britain.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that a modified shampooing
would form a valuable addition to the
Anglo-Turkish bath; that the friction of the skin,
the pressing and kneading of the muscles, the traction
of the sinews, the playing of the joints, even
a certain pressure of the viscera, would be attended
with benefit; and when there existed stiffening
or thickening from chronic disease, as of rheumatism
and gout, of immense advantage. The
British shampooer has all this to learn, and we
commend to him two considerations&mdash;agility and
moderation.</p>

<p>After the shampooing&mdash;the second operation of
the bath, that which immediately follows the seasoning
of the body by warmth and moisture&mdash;there
comes the <span class="smcap">THIRD OPERATION</span>, the rolling and peeling
of the outer layers of the scarf-skin; an operation
in which the Turks are very expert. The scarf-skin
has become softened and swollen by the warm moisture
of the atmosphere and the exudation of perspiration
from the skin, and is in a state ready for
peeling and collecting into rolls and removing by
the process of friction with the camel's-hair or
goat-hair glove, the <em>kheesah</em> of India. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
operation there is no soap employed, the skin is as
yet untouched with soap, and we rely for our success
on simple friction. The Moors commence the
process a little earlier, before the scarf-skin is thoroughly
soaked, and use <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">gazul</i>. The Turks give a
longer period to the softening of the albuminous
layers of the epidermis, and <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">gazul</i> ceases to be necessary.
We have no grease well powdered with
dust to require the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strigil</i> of the Romans; we have
no <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">gazul</i>; and we therefore follow in the footsteps
of the Turk: we soak lengthily, lazily in our Tepidarium,
or the cooler side of our Calidarium, and
when we have artistically softened the epiderm,
when we are done to a turn, we assume the glove,
and we sweep with long strokes and firmly over
the skin from the nuque to the podex, from the
brow to the toe's end, until we have rolled and slid
off the softened layers, and have developed the pure
and satiny surface beneath. The old scarf is shed,
we cast our exuviæ, and we are refulgent in the
brightness and purity of our newest garment.
After this, a warm flood of water, rushing upon
us like a summer shower, or streaming over us
like a waterfall from the regions of the sun; and
all the foul scales that constitute the paved mosaic
of the outward man are washed clean away.</p>

<p>In the public bath, this delicious operation is
performed by the bath attendant, by the shampooer,
the tellak, or in whatever other name he
may delight. In the private bath, the host is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
condescending as to give his guest a rub down, or
an obliging and expert "companion of the bath"
does the kind office for his fellow C.B., particularly
if he be a callous, horny-skinned, and begrimed novitiate.
We have seen Mr. Witt playing the camel's-hair
glove, with the grace of an Apollo, by the
hour; we have had our own epidermal integument
groomed with most exquisite tenderness by a noble
of the highest rank, for the time our "companion
of the bath;" by those veteran pioneers of the
bath, Mr. Witt and Mr. Rolland; and we have
travelled in imagination to the ancient Phœnician
city of Dar el Baida, nay, to the antediluvian
Baalbec itself, gazing in admiration on the very
features of the "giants that lived in those days,"
and on their marvellous achievements, and embarking
with Noah and his sons in their vast and
wonderful ship, while Mr. Urquhart has been sweeping
adown our back and limbs with the camel's-hair
pad filled with Mauritanian gazul, at his delightful
Tusculum at Riverside.</p>

<p>The next operation, the fourth in order of proceeding,
brings into play the soap and the wisp of
the white fibre of the Mecca palm&mdash;the <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">lyf</i>. The
bather stands before the operator, or sits on the
margin of the sunken basin that serves as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lavatrina</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">labrum</i>; the operator draws towards him
the wooden basin, half filled with warm water, or
warm suds, or in the Turkish Hamâm with soft
soap; he dips his white bunch of lyf in the snowy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
lather, or rubs it well with Castile or ordinary
soap, and he then gently, but thoroughly, glides
over the entire surface of the bather, from the
crown of the head to the soles of the feet. How
exquisite is the feeling of the cleansing operation
to the sensorium of the skin; and how still more
enjoyable is the warm cascade which bursts over
him as soon as the soaping and its accompanying
friction are at end; how difficult to bring the mind
to the belief that we have had enough. Were not
thankfulness in the ascendant at our recovered
purity, we might be so sinful as to regret that so
delicious an enjoyment had come to an end.</p>

<p>But if the sensation of the warm shower is
agreeable, no less so is the process which immediately
succeeds&mdash;namely, a douse, or douche, of
the coldest water. The body is so thoroughly
warmed by the preceding operations, that instead
of striking a chill, as might be imagined by the
inexperienced, the coldness is most grateful, and
the feeling of freshness most exhilarating. Sometimes,
an alternate douche of hot and cold water
is repeated in rapid succession, and it is a little
difficult for the bather to say which of the two is
at the moment bursting over him.</p>

<p>The intention of the cold affusion is to produce
contraction of the seven millions of pores which
open on the surface of the skin. They have acted
freely, they have performed the duty that was
required of them: the key may now be turned, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
lock closed; they may be sealed up for the present,
to be ready for further service at a future time.
The Romans often concluded their bath by plunging
into a cold pool, to attain the same object&mdash;the
closure of the pores; and the Turks, as we have
already seen, omit the cold affusion, excepting to
the feet, and rely upon the cool atmosphere of their
great hall, open to the sky, and to the cooling
influence of the current of air produced by a fan.</p>

<p>Where a middle room or Tepidarium exists, the
process of washing, beginning with the inunction
with soap and ending with the cold douche, is performed
in that apartment. But where there is no
Tepidarium, the process is gone through in some
convenient part of the Calidarium. If the former,
the bather returns to the Calidarium, and sits down
for a few minutes, until the skin becomes warm,
and any coldness is removed which may have been
occasioned by the douche. Or, if the Calidarium
have been the scene of the lavatory process, the
bather, in like manner, takes his seat on a bench
until all chill is dispelled.</p>

<p>With a skin perfectly warm, though no longer
perspiring, the bather now steps out of the Calidarium,
receiving either immediately before his
exit, or as soon as he may have entered the Frigidarium,
a warm, dry cotton mantle for his body,
and a warm, dry napkin for his head; the wet hip-cloth
is left behind in the Calidarium, or is dropped
at the entrance of the Frigidarium. The head and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
face are rubbed dry by means of the napkin, and
the mantle or sheet is wrapped around the body
and limbs, and the bather seats himself, or reclines
on the couch of repose, according to his taste; he
remains passive, or calmly conversing, and awaits
with patience the drying of his skin.</p>

<p>A good Frigidarium should be, as its name
implies, as cool as possible; a breeze of air sweeping
through the room is an advantage; the windows
should be open, for the bather courts the cool air,
and delights in feeling it play over his heated
limbs. The Romans had an open terrace connected
with the Frigidarium, in which the bathers could
walk, enveloped in their mantle; and a walk in
the open air, or in one of the charming garden
walks described by Pliny, would be most enjoyable.
No wiping, no friction is necessary to dry the skin;
the mantle absorbs some, and the cool air dissipates
the rest of the moisture. And after awhile the
skin is left dry, satiny, and warm, without trace of
moisture or clamminess, and in a state in which the
usual dress may be resumed. This is the moment
at which the description of Mr. Urquhart is properly
applicable:&mdash;"The body has come forth
shining like alabaster, fragrant as the cistus, sleek
as satin, and soft as velvet."</p>

<p>The bather should now put on his clothing slowly
and composedly; no haste should hurry his movements,
for haste might re-excite the perspiration,
the skin might again become moist, and <em>then</em> there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
would be danger of taking cold. But if the process
be properly conducted, cold is impossible; even the
sensation of cold is for the time lost. The bather
feels renovated, restored, buoyant, good-tempered,
strong, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau idéal</i> of God's divinest creation&mdash;man.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate the action of the bath by a
recent experience of my own, and at the same time
draw attention to the proper use of the bath, and
its singular power of effacing fatigue and painful
sensation of every kind&mdash;among others, the imperious
craving of hunger. A few weeks back,
after a day of severe labour, prolonged from six in
the morning until after seven at night, I arrived
hungry and weary at the house of my friend, Mr.
Stewart Rolland. I was expected, but was late;
and, as I entered his library, dinner was being
served. "Will you sit down with us," was my host's
salutation, "or will you take a bath?" "The bath!"
was my answer. "<i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">Ruat cœlum!</i>"</p>

<p>I had only to step into the next apartment, after
I had divested myself of my clothes, to find a
temperature of 150°. I took my place on a couch
covered with a soft Turkish sheet, and was soon
covered with perspiration, first as a thick dew, and
then as a dripping shower. The half-hour sand
glass had nearly run out, when I entered the
Lavatorium; I soaped myself thoroughly from
crown to sole; I turned a tap, when a cascade of
warm water poured over me, and rinsed away every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
particle of soap; a second tap, and I was in the
midst of a sheet of cold water. The pores were
now shut, and I returned to the Calidarium. A
few minutes sufficed to warm the skin, and then,
wrapped in a warm and dry mantle, I returned to
the cooling room, and threw myself on a divan.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes I was dry and dressed, and in
a state fitting to return to my friends, and eat with
appetite and with the certainty of digestion, anything
that might be set before me.</p>

<p>In the bath my fatigue had gone; the craving
hunger which I suffered on entering had ceased;
natural appetite had taken the place of morbid
hunger; the tired stomach had regained its power,
and was in a fitting state not only to receive whatever
food was given to it, but, better still, to digest
it. No wonder that the Arab of the desert prefers
the bath to food, and even to sleep; it supplies the
place of both.</p>

<p>I have portrayed Mr. Witt's bath; let me endeavour
to draw a sketch of Mr. Urquhart's bath&mdash;a
bath dear to the memory of all early bathers&mdash;the
bath at Riverside. We arrive at the door of
the Frigidarium, we loosen the latchets of our
shoes, and we leave them behind the lintel; the
portal opens, and we enter. The apartment is
small, but it is sunny and bright; through the glass
doors we see a balcony festooned with the tendrils
of the rose, now leafless and out of bloom, for it is
early winter; beyond the parapet of the balcony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
are terraces of which the rose is still the favoured
ornament; further on, the rippled surface of a
boisterous, noisy stream; then meadows with
grazing herds and flocks, and the faithful horse;
beyond, the wooded hill, arching like an eyebrow
around the bright spot in which, as the apple of the
eye, sparkles the bath. At our side is a dureta;
over against us a reclining chair; and along the
sides of the apartment a soft-cushioned divan; in
mid space a <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">sofra</i> supporting a nargillé; while
around are books, some Turkish ornaments and
chibouques; we tread on the carpet of Persia and
the clean, fresh, matting of India. Opposite the
glass doors is an immense sheet of plate glass,
through it we see marble steps, and in the depths
to which these steps descend there is the reflection
of the sun. Shades of Mecænas and Pliny, will ye
not smile? Shade of Seneca, look not austere at
the luxury of this Briton of ancient descent; who
courts the rays of Phœbus, smiling through festoons
of roses, to visit the deepest pool of his bath.
Here he can swim, while the sun glistens in the
crystal drops that linger on his skin, or makes
mimic rainbows in the spray that he dashes before
him in his plunging revel.</p>

<p>A door opens by the side of the immense barrier
of glass; we enter; the door closes behind us. Then
a second door; we pass through that, and we are
greeted with a delightful atmosphere; experience
tells us that no place of terrestrial existence can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
yield that soft, balmy, warm æther but one&mdash;that
one, the bath. We descend two steps, and reach
a platform, all of whitest marble; we become sensible
of an increase of warmth to the soles of our
feet as we descend, and we are glad to find soft
napkins spread on the lower steps to catch our footfall.
Two steps more, and then another platform:
the apartment expands at this point into a large
square lofty hall, and the marble platform stretches
from side to side the whole breadth of the hall. We
are sensible, as we stand on this platform, that we
have reached the tropical line of the bath, and that
at no great depth beneath our feet must be the
Hypocaust. To our right is a small square tent,
surrounded with scarlet hangings; this is the
<em>hottest of hots</em>, the Spartan Laconicum; it is placed
immediately over the furnace. We glance within
the parting curtains of the entrance; we see a
cushioned divan of tempting softness. At a later
stage of our bath, we pass ten minutes in that fiery
tent; its customary temperature is 240° or 250°.</p>

<p>On the left of our present station is another
divan, not enclosed by curtains like the other, but
admitting of being so if required. On this divan,
at a later stage of the bath, I spent many minutes
of genuine enjoyment; being farther from the furnace,
but still over the meridian of the Hypocaust,
it was less hot than the enclosed tent: its common
temperature is 170°. "If you would like a breath
of fresh air," said my host, "draw out that plug."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
I saw a plug just above my head, just near enough
to reach by stretching out my hand. I withdrew
it, not because I wanted air, but in a spirit of
obedience, or, if you will, of lazy indolence. What
a reward! what a delicious gush of ambrosial air!
Heavens! what Sybaritic contrivance is here? I
looked round for the shade of old Pliny, expecting
to see him peering over my shoulder; but he was
not there; the modest Roman shade was abashed,
was vanquished by the modern Mecænas: the perfume
was that of mignionette! Although the last
of the season, enough remained to enable my fancy
to judge how delicious that air must have been a
month or two earlier. This was one of the ventilating-holes
of the bath, and my host had brought
the air that was to cool his bath from the perfumed
atmosphere of a bed of mignionette. How I longed
at that moment for one half-hour of summer, that
I might test the other spiracles, that I might perchance
inhale the breath of roses here, and violets
or lilies there.</p>

<p>And now comes a deeper descent (four steps),
and behold, I am on the floor of the bath. Still
costly marble greets my tread. In the corner opposite
the fiery tent is another divan; here, far removed
from the torrid meridian, the temperature is
still lower (about 150°), but the atmosphere is everywhere
fresh: it is clear that ventilation is perfect,
and there are no vapoury mists, no fleeting gauze of
ghost-like moisture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>I am permitted to gaze about me for a while,
when my host leads me to a small recess on the
side corresponding with the couch of perfume. A
curtain is withdrawn, and I perceive that the bottom
of this recess is below the level of the floor, and that
a marble step placed at one end breaks the descent
to the bottom. The bottom, also, is peculiar: the
marble slab slopes downwards to an opening, through
which water finds its way into the drain. I am
aware that this is the Lavaterina or Latrina&mdash;that
here the novitiate is made to pass through the first
ordeal of the bath. Before he entered the sacred
precincts of the Apodyterium, he undid the latchets
of his shoes: he left his shoes beyond the door; he
brought with him none of the dust of the external
world into the portals of the bath. In the Frigidarium,
or rather in the Apodyterium, he left
behind him his vestments, and assumed the simple
garb of the inner bath. Now, and before he can
claim to select his place on the divans, he pays a
further tribute to the god of purity: the outer
layers of his scarf-skin must be peeled away&mdash;he
must yield up his skin to the ordeal of the glove,
the <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">gazul</i>, or the soap; and then, semi-purified, he
may range at will the apartment&mdash;he may explore
at leisure the mysteries of the bath.</p>

<p>We seat ourselves on the clean marble at the
edge of the Lavaterina; our host plays the soft pad
of <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">gazul</i> over the head, the back, the sides; we complete
the operation on the limbs and feet ourselves;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Basin after basin of warm water rinses the <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">gazul</i>
and the loosened epidermis from the surface, and
we rise from the Lavaterina to recommence our
observations.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of the flight of steps already
described, and occupying the centre of the remaining
wall of the hall, is a square pool, between four and
five feet in depth, and reached by several steps. In
this pool are two feet of water, perfectly cold, with
a tap from which as much may be obtained as may
be required. This water is pumped up from the
river, and filtered before it is admitted into the
bath: it, like the bather, is made to leave its dusty
shoes outside the door, and is thoroughly cleansed
before it is permitted to invade the sanctuary. In
this pool, this <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">piscina</i>, the bather refreshes himself
with a plunge in cold water&mdash;in the summer
cooled down with ice&mdash;when he issues heated from
the "hottest of hots," or when he completes the
bath; and here he may take his dip or his plunge,
his douche or his swim, with the sun shining in
upon his polished skin.</p>

<p>Having received my freedom of the bath in the
Lavaterina, I commenced a series of visits to all the
soft, the warm, the perfumed, the hot, the cool, the
cold nooks, that I could find. I rolled in enjoyment
on the divan by the side of the <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">piscina</i>, watching
my "companions of the bath," and especially a little
Antinous, or rather an infant Hercules, of five
years of age, who one while crept into the fiery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
tent, and another while disported himself like a
young sea-god, with evident delight, in the cold
<i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">piscina</i>. I then took my place in the higher temperature
of the torrid zone, on the divan that was
breathed over by the sweet expirations of the mignionette;
and anon crept into the tent with the
scarlet curtains serving as a door, and wondered
that I could breathe an atmosphere heated to 240°
without inconvenience.</p>

<p>It was now approaching the hour of breakfast,
and however disinclined I might be to leave the
warm world in which I had spent more than an
hour, I was ready to acknowledge certain material
warnings of the charms of breakfast. Before, however,
I could quit the bath, it was necessary that
the pores, which had been all this while filtering
the waste fluids of the body through their numberless
apertures, should be made to close; and with
this intent I descended into the pool, to experience
and enjoy a new sensation. I crouched under the
tap, while a cold torrent poured over me, the little
Hercules catching greedily on his head any waste
jets that glanced aside, and then shaking his flaxen
ringlets over his face and shoulders with a joyous
laugh. But my last experience was to come. At
the word "Hold firm!" a full pail of hot-water
rushed upon me like an avalanche, and was instantly
followed by the same quantity of cold; this was
repeated in quick succession a number of times, and
then, when my host's arms seemed tired of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
further repetition, I arose from the pool, and shook
my soused frame on the platform above, with a
feeling of freshness and vigour that I shall long
remember&mdash;remember when the bath and all its
vagaries shall have become too familiar to suggest
a note of their early impressions.</p>

<p>I was soon warm enough to quit the region of
water, and ascend into that of air&mdash;to quit the
region of fire, and mount into that of the sun, then
smiling beamingly in at the window. My host
gave my head a good rub with a warm, soft Turkish
napkin, and threw a warm mantle over my shoulders;
and it was with a feeling of "divided duty," the
bath on one side and the breakfast on the other,
that I ascended to the Frigidarium. Throwing
myself on a softly-cushioned dureta, a half-hour
was spent in suggestive and instructive conversation,
and then "to breakfast with what appetite we
may." Shades of immortal Shakespeare! Speaking
for myself, I should say, with the appetite of a
man. Need I say more. This is my memory of
the delicious bath at Riverside.</p>

<p>My host placed before me a dish, or rather a
basket, of that wonderful Moorish food, the <i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">kuscoussoo</i>,
and our conversation naturally drifted
away to the mode of preparing food pursued by
different nations, and particularly to the mode of
its preparation in the countries where the particular
food is indigenous. I was struck with my host's
remark, that while we draw food from other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
countries, we fail to learn the native manner of
preparing that food; and that from our ignorance
on this point we frequently deteriorate, and often
destroy its properties altogether.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the very highest branch
of the science of chemistry&mdash;that which has for its
object the <em>preparation of the food</em> which God in
his goodness has bestowed upon us, for the sustenance
and preservation of His greatest work, man
himself&mdash;should be so miserably neglected. How
much happier man's state would be if this department
of chemistry were more cultivated and better
understood; how greatly would the nutritive power
of food be developed, how much would be economized
in its use! How much might even the life
of man be prolonged! Of the many that die daily
in their beds, surrounded by warm coverings, costly
hangings, and sorrowing friends, there are many
who die of absolute starvation&mdash;starved, because
the modern science of culinary chemistry has no
better nourishment to offer than abominable beef-tea,
wretched mutton-broth, miserable arrowroot
or sago, or detestable gruel. Tell me, ye sick
who have so narrowly escaped death, whether what
I am saying is not perfectly true; and that between
nauseating physic on the one hand, and equally
nauseating diet on the other, have you not "run
the gauntlet" of destruction, from which your
escape is indeed miraculous?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The plan of the bath at Riverside was not lost
upon me in an undertaking on which I was then
engaged&mdash;namely, building a bath for myself. My
Apodyterium is at the back of my house; from
this a Xystos, with a glazed roof, leads to the outer
door of the Calidarium. Within the outer door is
a vestibule, which upon occasion may serve as a
Tepidarium. At the end of the vestibule is a
second door, and this opened, we are in the Calidarium,
an apartment more than ten feet high,
fifteen feet long, and twelve wide. Along the side
of the room runs a flue, with an area of four feet
by nine inches; the flue crosses the end, and
returns for a distance of two feet on the opposite
side. At the point of return is the chimney.
Two windows with thick glass let light into the
room; and five circular openings, four inches in
diameter, and closed by a telescopic lid (Looker's
ventilator), supply an abundance of air; while a
similar ventilator in the chimney-shaft secures its
free circulation. The floor is a tesselated pavement
of coloured octagonal tiles; and on the side
corresponding with the door is a sunken Lavaterina,
three feet six in length, two in breadth, and eighteen
inches deep. Over the centre of the Lavaterina
are two spouts, for cold and hot water; the
latter being obtained from a galvanized iron tank,
capable of holding twenty-five gallons, that stands
on the returned flue, against the chimney-shaft. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
this bath, as in Mr. Urquhart's, I expect to get
various degrees of temperature, increasing in altitude
from a temperate standard in the vestibule, to
the highest temperature that can be required, immediately
over the furnace, where I have established
my Laconicum.</p>

<p class="ph3">REVIVAL AND SANITARY PURPOSES OF THE
EASTERN BATH.</p>


<p>The Eastern Bath in its essential nature is a well
ventilated apartment, in which the air is heated to
an average temperature of 130 degrees of Fahrenheit.
The bather sits, or reclines, or stands, in this
apartment, moving about at his pleasure; while
the heat, by its stimulant action on the skin, causes
the perspiration to issue from its seven millions of
pores, and to flow over the surface in greater or
less abundance. While the perspiration is spreading
in a sheet over the skin, trickling downwards in
lively rills, and falling in continuous drops from all
the salient points of the frame, the bather gently
rubs his body and limbs with his hands; the softened
cuticle is raised in thin flakes, and if the
bath be taken but seldom, the cuticle is rubbed up
in such quantity as to form little elliptical rolls,
more or less begrimed with dirt. After the lapse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>of a certain number of minutes, varying from
twenty to sixty or more, the bather soaps himself
thoroughly; he then receives a shower of warm
water, which washes the soap and impurity from
the surface, and is most agreeable to the sensations.
He next has a shower or douche of cold water, which
effects the closure of the gaping pores, and is extremely
refreshing. He then envelopes his body in
a cotton mantle or sheet, and retiring to a cool
room, to which the external air is freely admitted,
he sits or reclines, remaining as impassive as possible,
until the skin is thoroughly dried, and feels
smooth and satiny in every part. The bather then
resumes his usual dress, and the process is complete.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The sanitary purposes</span> which the bath is calculated
to fulfil are three in number, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Preservation of Health.</span></p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Prevention of Disease.</span></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Cure of Disease.</span></p>


<p>The bath is <em>preservative of health</em>, by maintaining
a vigorous condition of the body; a state the best
suited for the happiness of the individual, as rendering
him in the highest degree susceptible of the
enjoyment of life; and a state the most advantageous
to social interests, as ensuring the highest
working condition.</p>

<p>The bath is <em>preventive of disease</em>, by hardening
the individual against the effects of variations and
vicissitudes of temperature, by giving him power
to resist miasmatic and zymotic affections, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
strengthening his system against aberrations of
nutrition and the fecund train of ills that follow
disturbance of the nutritive functions&mdash;namely,
scrofula, consumption, gout, rheumatism; diseases
of the digestive organs; cutaneous system; muscular
system, including the heart; nervous system, including
the brain; and reproductive system.</p>

<p>The bath is <em>a cure for disease</em> when the latter
state is already established, and is a powerful and
effective medicine.</p>

<p>These are a general summary of the nature and
attributes of the Eastern bath, which I shall now
endeavour to illustrate with more exactness and in
greater detail.</p>

<p>It is an interesting and important feature in
connexion with the revival of the bath in Britain,
after a lapse of fifteen hundred years, that it should
have been so eagerly taken up and adopted by the
working classes. Several baths, founded and maintained
by working men, have been established in
our great manufacturing towns&mdash;among others, in
Bradford, Barnsley, Sheffield, Manchester, Leeds,
Staleybridge, Rotherham, and Rochdale; and this
fact, together with the general popularity of the
bath among the artisan class, will doubtless lead
the thinking man to recognise in the institution
attributes of sterling value and prospective public
utility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h3>CONSTRUCTION OF THE BATH.</h3>

<p>The processes which constitute the Eastern bath&mdash;in
other words, the stages of the bath&mdash;are three
in number, namely:&mdash;1. Exposure of the naked
body to hot dry air; 2. Ablution with warm and
cold water; and, 3. Cooling and drying of the
skin.&mdash;The bath, or thermæ, should therefore consist
of three apartments devoted especially to the
three processes&mdash;namely, the hot room, or Calidarium;
the washing room, or Lavatorium; and the
cooling room, or Frigidarium. Or, for private use,
two rooms; or one room divided into two compartments,
Calidarium and Frigidarium, would be
sufficient; the Calidarium being used as a Lavatorium
after the sweating process is completed.</p>

<p>My friend, Mr. George Witt, of Prince's Terrace,
Hyde Park, to whom I am indebted for my first
introduction to the bath, possesses a bath of the
simple construction to which I am now alluding;
and as it fulfils very satisfactorily all the purposes
of the bath, I shall proceed to describe it, by way
of illustration of one of the simplest forms of bath
for private use. On the ground-floor of his house
he had a room twenty feet long by ten feet in
breadth, and twelve feet high, with a window looking
out upon a lead flat. To convert this room
into a thermæ he divided it into two compartments,
by means of a wall which crossed it at
about one-third from its further end. He had thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
two apartments&mdash;an outer one, the Frigidarium;
and an inner one, entered by two small doors,
outer and inner, in the partition wall, the Calidarium.
To preserve the heat of the Calidarium a
lath and plaster lining was placed inside and at the
distance of a few inches from the wall, and the
space between the lining and the wall filled in with
sawdust. The same was done to the ceiling, and
the floor was paved with earthen tiles set on concrete.
On the side corresponding with the exterior
of the house a square of thick glass was let
into the wall, and, above and below, were four
circular holes three inches in diameter, and fitted
with plugs for the purpose of ventilation. Further,
in the partition wall was a small square of glass
through which a thermometer could be seen from
the outside, and a gas-burner from the inside, enabling
the bather to ascertain the temperature of
the Calidarium from the outside without opening
the doors, and supplying a light exterior to the
Calidarium when the bath is used in the evening.</p>

<p>Following this description, it will be seen that
the Calidarium or Sudatorium is simply a closed
chamber, with an area of sixty-five superficial feet,
and containing seven hundred and fifteen cubic feet
of atmospheric air, the actual measurements being
ten feet long by six feet and a half wide, and eleven
feet high; this chamber being provided with sufficient
means of ventilation through the agency of
the imperfectly-fitting doors, and also the occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
opening of the doors on one side, and the four holes,
already described as existing in the exterior wall,
on the other; and also, supposing the doors to be
more closely shut, between an ingoing current of
cold air through the two lower holes, and an outgoing
current of hot air through the upper holes.
Ten persons can take the bath without discomfort,
and without being overcrowded in Mr. Witt's
thermæ; I have myself formed one of nine, but
with six or seven the space is more than ample.</p>

<p>Let me now turn to the means of heating the
Calidarium. In the exterior wall, near its bottom,
and opening on the lead flat, is a furnace of the
commonest possible construction, and capable, from
its free draught, of burning the commonest combustible
material&mdash;such as inferior coal, coal screenings,
coke, cinders, and sawdust. This furnace, encased
in brickwork, is carried obliquely for a distance
of four or five feet into the Calidarium; and
its flue, following the angle of the floor, makes the
circuit of the apartment. The flue next ascends
perpendicularly for a few feet, crosses the wall
above the brickwork which encloses the furnace,
and then makes its way up the angle of the room
to the ceiling, where it escapes by means of a
chimney. The flue, in its course around the room,
is raised from the level of the floor, and separated
from the wall by the breadth of a brick, and consequently
presents a free surface on all sides for the
radiation of heat. Its radiating surface is about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
one foot square, and its length thirty-five feet. The
common temperature maintained in Mr. Witt's
Calidarium is 130° to 140° of Fahrenheit. Mr.
Witt tells me that he has had it as high as 180°;
and I have myself been in it, in company with my
friend Mr. Chadwick, at 150° of Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>As the British thermæ is at present in a state of
infancy, the question of construction, in reference
to the threefold condition, of size of apartment,
degree of ventilation and temperature, and materials,
is before us for inquiry and research. The
common plaster walls of Mr. Witt's Calidarium
answer perfectly: they are not too hot for the
naked skin, as a glazed or polished material would
be; and they admit of cleansing by water, whenever
necessary. The red and blue earthen tiles of his
bath give a pleasant holding to the soles of the
feet on account of their roughness, and with the
intramural position of the flue never become too
hot. Glazed tiles, although more elegant in appearance,
are too hot for contact with the skin, and
require, consequently, to be trodden on with wooden
clogs; moreover, when at all moistened, they are
slippery and dangerous. Therefore, so far as our
present means of information go, it would appear
that the more economical materials of construction
answer in every way the best. We are, however,
still open to instruction on these points, as well as
in many others appertaining to the bath, and we
shall probably be doing best to adhere as closely as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
possible to the Turkish model. Can the furnace, as
at present described, be improved? What combustible
material would be the most economical;
taking into consideration the questions of price, of
rapidity of combustion and of deposition of soot in
the flue, requiring more or less frequent cleansing?</p>

<p>The flue in Mr. Witt's bath is constructed of
galvanized iron plate, and is square in form. This
flue answers very well, but Mr. Witt does not approve
of iron, because in a hot dry atmosphere particles
of the metal are thrown off and mingle with the
air. The best material for the construction of the
flue is earthen tiles or bricks; probably pipes fitting
end to end may, with some modification, be made
to answer the purpose, but heretofore they have
been found to split with the heat. Then, in the
case of building a bath, the relative value of bricks,
and especially of hollow bricks, and pierced bricks,
and bricks with a surface finish, come under consideration.</p>

<p>Immediately over the fine passing around the
floor of the Calidarium is a wooden seat; and over
the masonry of the furnace, a wooden step and
platform affording additional sitting room. On the
platform is a wooden couch, shaped like a straddling
letter W, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dureta</i> from the hardness of
its material, but in reality forming a most pleasant
and agreeable couch, as the angles of the couch correspond
with the joints of the body when in a reclining
position. The dureta was borrowed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the Emperor Augustus from Spain, or rather from
Morocco through Spain,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and contributes greatly to
the luxury of the bath.</p>

<p>It is a fault in Mr. Witt's bath that the flue
entirely surrounds the floor of the Calidarium, and
consequently crosses the entrance door, rendering it
necessary to the bather to step down from the seat
to the floor of the apartment in going in, and to
step upwards in going out. This arrangement leads
to occasional slips, particularly when the floor is
wet; and although unimportant to persons in the
full vigour of health, calls for caution in all, and
especially on the part of those who are in any degree
infirm; and becomes a serious impediment
where it is necessary to lift an invalid into the
bath. Fortunately the inconvenience admits of an
easy remedy; the flue, when it reaches the jamb of
the doorway, may be carried over the door and so
onwards along the side of the room; or it may be
doubled back upon itself and made to return to the
line from which it started, and then carried to any
point of exit that may be suitable. A better
material for the flue is brickwork; and as the intention
of the flue is to afford a large surface for
the radiation of heat, the plan has been adopted of
making flues of large size, for example, three or four
feet in height. A short length of a flue of these
dimensions is equivalent to three or four times the
length of a flue of one foot square, and its course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>along two or three sides of the room affords as
much heat as can be required. I visited lately a
small bath in Bell-street, Edgeware-road, in which
a flue of this construction, about three feet in height
and nine inches in width, ran along three sides of
the room, and gave out a temperature of 160°.</p>

<p>In the Turkish bath and in some of the modern
British Thermæ the flues are carried under the
floor, constituting a kind of Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypocaustum</i>,
and are made to describe a series of parallel rows,
which traverse from side to side and are connected
at the ends. A very high degree of temperature is
attained by this arrangement, as in the private
bath of Mr. Stewart Rolland, of Victoria-street,
Westminster; but it presents this manifest objection,
namely, that the floor is so hot as to
be unbearable to naked feet or to a naked skin,
and is therefore not without danger to an invalid
who may have accidentally fallen on the ground.
Again, where very high temperatures are obtained,
the woodwork of the seats becomes so hot as
to render coverings of some kind necessary. The
temperature of Mr. Stewart Rolland's Calidarium,
when fully heated, ranges between 150° and 170°,
while with the aid of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laconicum</i> he is able to
carry his temperature twenty degrees higher; his
couches and seats are, therefore, covered with cotton
sheets having a thick pile; and in place of wood he
uses fibrous slabs, which have a lower conducting
power and are less influenced by the heat. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in the construction of his walls he employs felt, on
account of its non-conducting and non-inflammable
properties, as an intermediate layer, in place of the
sawdust used by Mr. Witt.</p>

<p>From want of space, as I have before remarked,
Mr. Witt's Calidarium becomes his Lavatorium at
the conclusion of the sweating process; and no inconvenience
results from this arrangement, because
ample time can be spared for the drying up of the
moisture before the bath is required for use a second
time. But where the requisite extent of space
exists, and, as a necessity in a public bath where a
succession of bathers enter and depart, a separate
apartment should be devoted to the purposes of a
Lavatorium. And, as the Lavatorium should adjoin
the Calidarium, a few feet of the flue may be
introduced into the partition wall between the two,
and made to warm the air of the Lavatorium,
converting it, in fact, into a Tepidarium. The
Tepidarium of the ancient Roman Thermæ was an
apartment of an intermediate temperature between
the Frigidarium and the Calidarium, and supplied
a transition medium between the two extremes;
warming and relaxing the body on its way from
the Frigidarium to the Calidarium on the one
hand, and qualifying the depression of the temperature
from the Calidarium to the Frigidarium
on the other.</p>

<p>Before its escape from the Calidarium, the flue is
made to heat the water which is required for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
rinsing the body after thorough friction with soap.
For this purpose a tank holding a few gallons of
water (Mr. Witt's tank holds ten gallons) is fixed
on a portion of the fine at the upper part of the
bath, and a short descending pipe, with a horizontal
arm fitted at the end with a rose, distributes a
grateful shower of warm water over the bather.
Another horizontal arm, with or without a rose,
brings the cold water, with which the ablution is
completed, into the Lavatorium, and is distributed
either as a copious shower or as a descending
douche, as the bather may desire. In Mr. Stewart
Rolland's bath I was indulged with an alternate
douche of hot and cold water, which was wonderfully
delicious.</p>

<p>The third compartment of the bath (the Frigidarium)
may be as large as convenient, but should
be abundantly supplied with the means of procuring
fresh air, and even a current of air; it is not only
a cooling-room, but also a drying-room, for in it the
moisture left on the body is thoroughly evaporated,
and the skin becomes smooth and satiny. The
Frigidarium should be furnished with a couch and
a few easy chairs, and as it is intended to be trodden
with naked feet, it should have a clean wooden floor
or a mat. Moreover, it is here that fresh water
may be kept for drinking, or the acidulated drinks,
or the sherbet. It is here also that should be found
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Columbarium</i>, with its pigeon-holes for receiving
the mantles, the sheets, the towels, the cummer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>bunds,
the combs, together with any other appurtenances
of the bath that may be in use.</p>

<p>Again, in the two or three-roomed bath, a portion
of the Frigidarium may be devoted to the purpose
of a dressing-room, Apodyterium, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vestiarium</i>.
Here the clothes may be hung up on pegs as they
are removed, and here shoes and boots should be
left, the presence of shoes being strictly prohibited
in the proper cooling part of the room. In this
arrangement we are made aware that among the
Romans the Frigidarium and the Vestiarium were
separate apartments, and formed a portion of that
series which Pliny conceived might, with the
strictest economy of space, be comprehended in five
or seven rooms, but would be more completely
carried out in nine. The Frigidarium of the
Romans, like the Mustaby of the Turks, was open
to the vault of heaven.</p>

<p>Such is the Eastern bath, in reference to the
question of construction; it is either a spare room
with a partition, a furnace and chimney, and a small
reservoir of water; or it is an outhouse with a
similar arrangement; or it is five walls, with a
roof, erected in a convenient spot; or it is an
elegant "hothouse," pendent to a country villa; or
it may be an architectural wonder of ancient Roman
grandeur. In other words, it may come within the
reach of the poor man, at the expenditure of a few
shillings or pounds, or it may be the metamorphosis
of hundreds and thousands of pounds into a palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of magnificence and luxury. But the poor man's
bath will be essentially as perfect as that of Dives,
and he will, if he be wise, carry the balance of cost
to the education of his children. In a small society
of neighbours, clubbing their means, the bath would
cost less than the tobacco-pipe; and where the
rules of the Bath are rigidly enforced, as they invariably
should be, the Bath would become a school
of moral discipline as well as physical health, and
be a potent counterblast to the public-house.</p>


<h3>OPERATION OF THE BATH.</h3>

<p>We will now <em>take</em> a bath. We will endeavour
to solve the question, <span class="smcap">What is the Bath?</span> We
enter the Apodyterium or Vestiarium; we divest
our body of its clothing; we hang our garments
orderly on the apportioned pegs; we place our
boots on the ground under our clothing, pushing
the socks into the boots; we fold the <em>cummerbund</em>,
a scarf of the Turkish red twilled cotton eight feet
long and eighteen inches broad, around our hips,
or we may prefer a kilt of the same material, or a
pair of short drawers, and we are ready to enter the
Tepidarium, if such there be; or, in the absence of
a Tepidarium, the Calidarium. This is the costume
of the Bath, and a costume is indispensable. Without
a costume in the presence of others, the bath is not
the bath&mdash;it is an evil, and as an evil it should be
suppressed with the utmost severity. But I am
not describing the Bath for those who would abuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
it, but for those only who have the intelligence to
apply it to the high and noble purposes of which it
is capable. An addition to the above simple costume
is sometimes made by folding a cotton scarf
around the head&mdash;a kind of turban; and the turban
has its advantages, as a protection of the bare head
against the extreme heat of the apartment. The
turban, when used by the gentler sex, protects and
supports the hair, and the cummerbund gives place
to a loose cotton chemise, that of the Turkish red
twill being the most becoming and appropriate.</p>

<p>We now enter the Calidarium; we are impressed
with the sensation of a most agreeable
warmth; we look at the thermometer, we find the
temperature to be 135° of Fahrenheit; we take
our position on one of the seats, or we ascend upon
the platform above, and we discover that a hard
wooden couch, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dureta</i>, may be the pleasantest
couch in the universe. We look around us; the
atmosphere is clear, there is no haze upon the
window, the floor, the seats, and the walls are dry,
and yet there is no oppression to the breathing
organs; we breathe as agreeably as in the open air&mdash;nay,
those who are ordinarily oppressed in the
air from chronic bronchitis or asthma breathe more
lightly and pleasantly here. But I must explain:
I am now describing the sensations experienced in
Mr. Witt's bath, and the freshness of the atmosphere
of Mr. Witt's bath has always been praised
by the most experienced bathers, and by those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
have been accustomed to the Bath in the East.
Mr. Witt attributes this virtue of his bath, and
with apparent reason, partly to sufficient ventilation,
and partly to the presence of his warm-water
tank in the upper portion of the apartment; the
water of this tank, evaporated by the heat of the
flue, descends into the apartment, and pervades the
atmosphere as an invisible vapour&mdash;a vapour which
is felt, but not seen; and he further remarks that
a similar effect is not attainable by the introduction
of water on the floor of the bath.</p>

<p>If, after our first entrance into the Calidarium,
we place the hand on any part of our skin, it gives
the sensation of coldness, as compared with the
temperature of the apartment. Soon, however,
the skin becomes warm and dry; shortly afterwards
it is moist and clammy; and later still, the
perspiration begins to flow with greater or less
activity. The freedom of perspiration follows the
known structure of the skin in reference to the
sudatory organs; it is first perceptible and most
abundant on the face and hands, where the sudatory
glands are most numerous and most developed; it
succeeds on the chest and shoulders, then on the
rest of the body, and lastly, on the legs below the
knees. The perspiration at first issues from the
pores in minute drops, the drops swell to the size
of peas, and the skin looks as if it were garnished,
with crystal beads; the beads run into little rills,
and the rills trickle down the hollow ways of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
surface in small streams. It is at this period that
the whole body admits of being washed by means
of the water that issues from itself, and that the
secret of the small quantity of water provided for
the baths by the Romans is discovered.</p>

<p>It is when the perspiration commences to flow
in abundance, that the beginner in the use of the
bath, or the owner of a susceptible constitution,
becomes aware of an increase of rapidity of the
heart's pulsations; and this sensation is commonly
associated with a feeling of oppression, something
approaching to faintness. On the first hint of this
sensation, the bather should retire to the Tepidarium
or to the Frigidarium, and sit there for a
few minutes, or until the sensation has ceased; he
may then return to the Calidarium, and upon each
recurrence of the sense of oppression always quit
the Calidarium for the cooler temperature without.
The sensation which I am now describing is the
only disagreeable one attendant upon the use of the
bath; it is unknown to the practised bather, and
to the strong or callous constitution, and may be
effectually obviated, even in the most sensitive, by
the simple precaution which I have just suggested.
Strange to say, these passages from the hot to the
cold temperature are not attended with a check to
the perspiration, they only moderate it, while the
stimulus of the fresh air provides more ample chest-room
for the oxygenization of the lungs.</p>

<p>One of the most curious, and at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
impressive, of the phenomena of the bath, is the
relative freedom of perspiration of the educated
and the uneducated skin; in other words, of the practised
and the unpractised bather. There are certain
persons who have never perspired, and these persons
require a long training in lower temperatures before
they can be admitted with safety to the higher
temperatures; they are also much assisted by the
addition of watery vapour to the hot air, converting
it, in fact, into a vapour-bath. But of the rest of
mankind, who present every facility for active perspiration,
but who have never had, or but seldom
have, the skin aroused to its normal activity, the
variety in the energy of perspiration is very remarkable.
The practised bather is enveloped in a
sheet of perspiration, while the skin of the beginner
is hardly moist; if the practised bather but raise
his arm, the water drips from his elbows and finger-ends
in continuous drops; his cummerbund is saturated,
and the water may be wrung from it as from
a soddened cloth, while the cummerbund of the
neophyte is still dry. If the beginner rest his back
for an instant against the wall of the Calidarium,
he shrinks away from it, because of the intensity
of its heat; but the practised bather presses against
it with all his force, and receives only the sensation of
an agreeable warmth, because the abundant moisture
of his skin is sufficient to keep the wall cool. The
beginner loses the moisture only of the surface of
the body, and feels no resulting internal sensation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
but, in the practised bather, the skin sucks up the
watery fluids from the deeper streams of the sanguine
flood, and the bather thirsts in the operation.
He drinks water from time to time to replenish the
waste; pint upon pint is taken into his stomach,
and finds its way firstly into the blood, and then
into the sudatory system of the skin; surely an
apparatus of organs and a current of blood so
rinsed by the transit of pure water must undergo
an important purification. To the practised bather
the drinking of water during the perspiration of
the body is reviving and necessary, because his
blood has need of water to supply the place of that
which has been withdrawn by the skin, and the
amount of need is expressed by his thirst. But the
beginner has no thirst, and he will do well to avoid
drinking, as calculated to increase the labour of
perspiration, and likely therefore to be followed by
oppression and faintness.</p>

<p>The time passed in the Calidarium, with the
occasional retirements already mentioned, may vary
between twenty minutes and an hour; <em>a continuous
moderate perspiration of a certain duration</em> being
the object which should be kept in view. Besides
causing an active perspiration, the warmth and
moisture of the Bath soften the epiderm or scarf-skin,
and by gentle friction with the hand the
softened epiderm is rubbed off in small elliptical
cylinders. At the conclusion of the bath the skin
should be gently rubbed over with soap, applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
either with the kheesah or goat-hair glove, or with
a wisp of lyf&mdash;the white woody fibre of the Mecca
palm, commonly used for the purpose in the East.
After the friction with soap, the body should be
thoroughly rinsed by means of the warm shower-bath;
and after the warm shower-bath follows a
shower of cold water, or a cold douche. The idea
of a douse of cold water upon a fully perspiring
skin suggests a feeling of alarm in the minds of
those who have not experienced it, or have not
thought upon the matter; but in practice it is
inexpressibly grateful to the sensations, and wholly
free from the shadow of danger.</p>

<p>The purpose of the cold douche is to cause a
sudden shrinking or contraction of the skin, and
this contraction closes all the pores, and tightens
and braces the cutaneous vessels. The process is
necessarily accompanied with a trifling amount of
cooling of the surface, and the bather remains in
the Calidarium for a few minutes longer, until this
coolness has passed away, and the skin is everywhere
warm to the touch. He then leaves the Calidarium,
and enters the Frigidarium. When the bather
possesses a separate Lavatorium, the process of
soaping, with the subsequent ablutions, is performed
in that apartment; and, being accomplished, he
returns to the Calidarium to recover his warmth,
and is then ready for the Frigidarium. The warming
of the body after the cold douche is thus shown
to be an important part of the bath&mdash;as, in fact, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
every process, howsoever trivial each may seem
when considered separately and by itself.</p>

<p>On entering the Frigidarium the bather is enveloped
in a large cotton sheet or mantle, which
covers him from the head to below the feet; he lies
or sits down, enclosing each limb in a separate fold
of the sheet, and he wipes his face and head with a
dry napkin, or with a corner of the sheet. He
then remains perfectly tranquil and quiescent, the
sheet absorbs any excess of moisture, and the accumulated
heat of the body disperses the rest. After
fifteen or twenty minutes he exposes an arm to the
air; then both arms and the upper part of the
trunk of the body; then the lower limbs; bringing
every part of the skin in succession into relation
with the cool air or cool breeze of the apartment.
Of course, where an attendant is attached to the
bath, the investiture with the mantle, the wiping
of the head and face, the wrapping of the separate
limbs, and the packing of the body, are performed
by such attendant, or one bather performs the
office for another; but where the bather is alone,
he finds no difficulty in doing it all for himself.</p>

<p>The cooling and drying process, which is the
special use of the Frigidarium, is regarded by
experts as not the least important part of the
curriculum of the bath. It is here that the
moisture is dissipated from the skin by the heat of
the body, that the bather recovers from any little
physical exhaustion that the processes of the Lava<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>torium
may have occasioned, that the skin is brought
into contact with the open air, and imbibes its
oxygen; that the man becomes sensible of a delicious
repose of the nervous system, and an equally
agreeable restoration of his powers. If the quiet
impassibility of the Roman, or the listlessness of
the Turk, is to be imitated in the preceding stages
of the bath, it is doubly deserving of imitation
here; calm, repose, dignity, thankfulness, should
fill the soul of the bather while in the Frigidarium.
When his skin is perfectly dry, but still warm,
smooth, and satiny to the touch, then, and then
only, slowly and leisurely, he should begin to resume
his usual clothing. If he dress too soon he will be
apt to break out into a perspiration while putting
on his clothes, or after quitting the bath; in which
case he will be in danger of taking cold, and frustrating
the benefits of the bath.</p>


<h3>SANITARY PURPOSES OF THE BATH.</h3>

<p>In reference to the sanitary purposes of the
bath, I assume that it is Preservative of Health;
that it is Preventive of Disease; and that it is
also Curative of Disease.</p>

<p>The mode in which its power operates in the
fulfilment of these results is by the production and
maintenance of a healthy skin. A healthy skin I
therefore assume to be the end and aim of the
bath; and to support my argument it will be
necessary that I should point out the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of a healthy skin in the animal economy, and those
conditions and circumstances of common life that
tend to deteriorate its structure and function; to
show, in fact, why the skin is worth preserving,
and how its preservation in a state of health conduces
to the health of the entire organism.</p>

<p>The skin, from its large extent, deserves to be
ranked among the great organs of the body, and
belongs especially to that group that are commonly
called emunctory&mdash;in other words, the cleansers or
purifiers of the blood. In this sense it ranges side
by side with the liver and kidneys; and, all things
considered, it would be a difficult problem for any
physiologist to solve, to determine which of the
three deserves to stand before the others in importance.
These three organs are sometimes called
the scavengers of the body; and they may with
considerable truth be regarded as three great and
important systems of purification and drainage.</p>

<p>Now, if to drain the system of its impurities, to
cleanse and purify the blood of the animal economy,
three grand systems of drainage are required, the
inference is plain, that one would not be enough&mdash;that
two might perform the office, but with a strain
upon the machinery. But to be perfect, to perform
the office completely and efficiently, to be, in fact,
in health, to constitute health, all are needful.
Therefore, if in the course of these observations I
can show that one of these scavengers is weakened
in its powers, and being weakened in itself, throws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
an additional degree of labour on the remaining
two; if, in fact, our present mode of management
of the skin tends to deteriorate its powers as a
purifier of the body, and consequently produces a
strain on the liver and kidneys, which leads to their
deterioration and disease, I shall, provided I can
also show that the bath preserves the health of the
skin, make out a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primâ facie</i> case in favour of the
bath.</p>

<p>But it is not as an emunctory or purifier only
that we must regard the skin; its influence and
power have a wider range of action in the maintenance
of health. Besides comprehending a vast
system of drainage tubes, which open on the surface
by seven millions of pores, and which in actual
measurement would stretch over nearly thirty
miles if laid end to end; besides this, which belongs
to its purely emunctory function; besides, also, a
wonderful and perpetual labour, by which the
skin is drawing from the blood certain organic
elements in the fluid state, and converting them
into solid organic formations, which are known as
cells and scales, these cells and scales being the
tesselated mosaic with which the skin is finished
upon the surface, so as to render it capable of
existence in the atmosphere of the external world;
besides this, and much more, unnecessary in this
place to detail, the skin is converted into a kind of
sponge by the myriads of bloodvessels which enter
into its structure&mdash;bloodvessels, that many times in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
an hour bring the whole&mdash;ay, every drop&mdash;of the
blood of the body to the surface; bring it that it
may furnish the materials for the microscopic pavement;
that it may be purified by the abstraction
of its unwholesome principles; that it may breathe
the vital air of the atmosphere without;&mdash;besides
this, also, the skin near its surface is one vast network
of nerves&mdash;nerves, mysterious organs, that
belong in their nature to the unknown sources of
the lightning, the electric currents of the universe.
And, besides these again, there is every variety of
animal tissue and contrivance by which all this
apparatus is held together and maintained in the
best state and position to ensure its safety and
perfection. In truth, the contemplation of the
structure and functions of the skin, when viewed
with the eyes of the mind, is almost overwhelming;
and as we gasp breathless, to gain an instant of
reflection, the words of the Poet break upon our
memory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"In human works, though labour'd on with pain,</div>
      <div class="verse">A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;</div>
      <div class="verse">In God's, one single can its end produce,</div>
      <div class="verse">Yet serves to second, too, some other use."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>One word more as to the importance of the skin
in the animal economy, and that word a summary
of its functions and principal vital attributes. The
skin is a "sanitary commissioner," draining the
system of its impurities; it is an energetic labourer,
in that perpetual interchange of elements which in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
essence constitutes life; it is a regulator of the density
and fluidity of the blood; it performs the office of a
lung in supplying the blood with oxygen, and
abstracting its carbon; it changes the crude organic
elements of the blood, so as to render them capable
of nutrition; it emulates the heart in giving speed
to the circulating blood; it is the minister of the
brain and spinal marrow in its properties of sensation;
and it feeds and nourishes, and keeps in the
highest operative condition, that part of the nervous
system which is confided to its care. Viewing the
skin in this way, and recognising its just claims to
consideration as an important animal organ, we are
led to the conclusion that the skin is a part of the
digestive system, like the liver and kidneys, by
virtue of its emunctory and nutritive powers; it is
an appendage of the heart and a part of the system
of circulation of the blood; it is a surface lung, a
breathing organ; and it partakes of man's intellectual
nature by its close connexion with, and
dependence on, the brain. In the lower animals,
the skin combines in itself alone, the feeling, seeing,
smelling, hearing, and judging organ.</p>

<p>The structure of the skin&mdash;with its drainage tubes
requiring a free exit; its streams of blood seeking
for oxygen from the air; its nerves demanding the
contact and stimulus of the atmosphere&mdash;obviously
points to the relation which should subsist between
man and the external world&mdash;to the fact that his
natural and intended state is one of nakedness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Certain portions of the skin, in different parts of
the world and among different nations, are commonly
exposed to the air as Nature doubtless
intended the whole body to be. Our faces and
hands; in women, the neck, and often the shoulders;
among the Highlanders, the lower limbs; these
portions of the body are naked, are unblushingly
exposed; and, as we all know, without inconvenience.
Who ever feared to take cold because
his hands and his face were open to the free air of
Heaven? What lady ever complained of inconvenience
resulting from her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décolleté</i> shoulders at
an evening party or the opera, or even from the
bitter draughts of night air that frequently close
those entertainments? Who ever heard of a Highlander
suffering from rheumatism in the knees?
That charming friend and companion of our youthful
dreams, Miss Jane Porter, who was always
taking colds from the slightest exposure of her skin
to the air, once said to her brother, who was a
physician,&mdash;"How I wish that my skin were all
face?" "Try and make it all face," was his reply.
And she partially succeeded; but for complete
success she wanted the knowledge of the Turkish
Bath.</p>

<p>The bath has the property of hardening and fortifying
the skin, so as to render it almost insusceptible
to the influence of cold. The feeling after
quitting the Calidarium is one of defiance of cold;
the bather has a longing for the cool air of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
outer world, and with no other covering than his
cotton mantle, a lawn or a terrace would be his
chosen resort if the opportunity were within his
reach. In the hands of Mr. Urquhart, the bath
has presented us with one remarkable instance of
the power of endurance of the skin developed by
its aid. A fine, athletic child of five years old has
been brought up in the bath, and has never worn
other clothes than a loose linen garment. He is a
sturdy little fellow, with the independence of deportment
of an Indian and the symmetry of an
Apollo. He was met one wintry day, when the
snow was on the ground, walking in the garden,
perfectly naked. "Do you feel cold?" inquired his
interlocutor. "Cold!" said the boy, touching his
skin doubtfully with his finger, "yes, I think I do
feel cold." That is, he felt cold to his outward
touch, but not to his inward sensations, and it required
that he should pass his finger over the surface
of his body as he would have done over a marble
statue to be sure, not that he was cold, for that he
was not, but to be convinced that his surface felt
cold.</p>

<p>That the skin of man can support the temperature
of a climate such as that of Britain, when trained
to it from the cradle, is perfectly clear; our forefathers,
the ancient Britons, wore no clothes.
The Roman invaders of Britain tell us of the
"naked savages of Scotland." The inhabitants of
the Tierra del Fuego at Cape Horn, a country colder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
than Britain, have no other clothing than a hide
which they hang on their windward shoulder; and
their children may be seen, perfectly naked, gambolling
on the sea-shore, and scrambling in the
bottoms of the boats that come off to the passing
ships. The mother of the little Apollo I have
already described called the attention of a friend to
the warmth of her infant's feet, and with the remark,
"While my old nurse was with me, the
child's feet were always cold, because she insisted
upon covering them up with socks; but now that I
leave them exposed to the air, they are constantly
warm."</p>

<p>I need scarcely say more to prove that the bath
gives endurance, and that endurance fortifies the
individual against a very prevalent cause of disease
in this climate&mdash;namely, colds and affections of the
chest and lungs. A Doctor of Divinity whom I
frequently met in Mr. Witt's Bath, told me that
during the winter-time he was scarcely ever free
from colds, often so severe as to lay him up for
several weeks, and that he also suffered from attacks
of neuralgia; but that, since he had adopted the use
of the bath twice a week, all disposition to colds
and neuralgia had ceased; and, for the first time
in sixteen years, he had passed the winter without
a cold.</p>

<p>It is impossible, therefore, to avoid the conclusion
that the close clothing of the body from the moment
of birth, and the continuance of the process through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>out
our lives, must tend to prevent the proper and
healthy development of the skin and also to debilitate
it; and that the opposite course, of exposing
the skin to the air, and promoting its natural
functions by means of the bath, must have the
contrary effect of hardening and strengthening the
skin and rendering its functions more perfect.</p>

<p>In the bath we learn to distinguish by the eye
and by the touch, the weak and the strong, the
unhealthy and the healthy skin; we find the former
pale, soft, flabby, wrinkled, sordid, starved, and
morbidly sensitive; while the latter is pink, hard,
firm, elastic, smooth, clear, sensible, and well
nourished. When the fingers are drawn forcibly
over the skin of the practised bather, the white
streaks caused by the pressure are instantly restored
to their pink hue when the pressure is relaxed;
the sanguineous stream seems to follow the
pressure like a surge and instantly obliterates its
effects; and the skin recoils with a snap like India-rubber
when it is pulled away from the body and
suddenly released. In the bath there are no
wrinkles and no decrepit age; the skin becomes
firm and elastic; it recovers its colour and its
smoothness; it fits close to the muscular frame
beneath, instead of falling away from it in grim
festoons; its hues are selected from the palette of
youth. But this is not all: as the skin regains its
health, the hair returns upon the scalp of the bald;
and white hairs which have crept untimely and un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>bidden
among the dark locks of mid-age, shrink
away from the sight, and seek a more suitable and
more unwholesome roost.</p>

<p>But these visual appearances of the skin, which
obviously indicate its unhealthy external characters,
also denote a deficient and imperfect circulation of
the blood; a deteriorated sensibility; a defective
cell-formation and secretion; an exhausted tone
and vigour.</p>

<p>In respect of one of these qualities&mdash;namely,
healthy sensibility of the skin&mdash;I met in the bath
with a curious and unexpected illustration. When
I was invited by Mr. Stewart Rolland to pass from
his Calidarium at a temperature of 170°, into his
Laconicum, in which the actual temperature was
190°, but the sensible temperature some degrees
higher, in consequence of the presence of watery
vapour, I was suddenly made aware that the skin of
my body had lost its power of appreciating the
higher degrees of heat, and that my face and hands
were my only reliable monitors of the actual elevation
of the temperature.</p>

<p>To the face and hands the temperature was for a
moment almost scalding, but my body was sensible
of no inconvenience. Had I been asked, before I
made this experiment, what part of the body would
have suffered most from the extreme heat, I should
have said, the skin of the trunk of the body, because
this is naturally the most sensitive from being
covered and protected by clothing; but I was un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>prepared
to find the real fact in the very reverse of
this&mdash;to learn that the skin of the trunk of the body
had lost its power of sensibility; in other words,
had become partially paralysed from disuse of its
proper functions.</p>

<p>In a word, the habit of clothing the body, of
keeping it shut in from the air and from the light,
weakens the nerves of the skin and consequently
the natural and healthy sensibility of the organ. Although
I could not appreciate the extreme heat of
Mr. Rolland's Laconicum, I should have suffered
acutely from a scratch, a pinch, or a blow on the
bare skin: but the habit of the bath would reverse
this unnatural sensitiveness, the skin would learn
to appreciate truly instead of mendaciously; and
blows, or pinches, or external injury, unless very
severe, would cease to be felt as an inconvenience
or an annoyance. The little boy bred in the bath
complains of no hurt when he is accidentally struck
or when he tumbles; and that which would be
punishment to another boy is none to him. This,
we see, must be the natural state of the skin, otherwise
the Indian could no more exist without clothes
than the lobster without his shell.</p>

<p>Another phenomenon of the bath shows the
power of increased firmness and solidity and strength
which the texture of the skin acquires by its use.
A person unaccustomed to the bath bruises without
any great force, and the discoloration of the bruise,
occasioned by the escape of blood from its vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and the dispersion of the blood in the texture of the
skin, lasts for a considerable time. Indeed, we know
of some skins that bruise upon the most moderate
pressure, even without a blow. But the practised
bather does not bruise, excepting from serious injury;
and, when he does bruise, the discoloration
is rapidly dissipated.</p>

<p>The power of influencing the skin by education
is also shown in the degree of facility with which
perspiration is induced in the bather. In the practised
bather the perspiration comes almost at call;
it comes soon, freely, abundantly: but in the
neophyte, the perspiratory fluid is slow to emerge
from its pores; it comes unwillingly and in insufficient
quantity. Each succeeding bath, however,
exhibits an improvement; and, in time, the perspiration
obeys the word of command in the pupil as
well as in the master.</p>

<p>I have assumed for the skin the possession of a
power of nutrition, and have in this way brought it
into the category of the digestive organs; let me
explain:&mdash;Nutrition, in its essence, is that interchange
of material, by the influence of which the
old material is removed and new material is deposited
in its place. Now, the emunctory function of
the skin obviously results in the removal of the old
material from the body, and in proportion to the
energy and completeness of its removal, will be the
eagerness of the tissues to take up new material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from the blood. If the skin be in the torpid and
atrophied state I have already described as the consequence
of our present habits of life, this source
of interchange, of nutrition, will be valueless: but
if, by improving the health of the skin through the
agency of the bath, or by any other method that
can be devised, we render its function more active
and energetic, we necessarily make nutrition also
more active and complete.</p>

<p>The accomplishment of this object is the basis of
that process known by the name of <em>training</em>, by
which animals are brought into the highest state of
condition and strength. It is for this that the racehorse
is galloped, and sweated, and often purged;
for this, also, the prize-fighter, the prize-rower, and
the prize-cricketer are made to go through a similar
ordeal. It requires little argument to show how admirably
the bath is suited to this purpose; the sweating,
the cleansing, the strengthening of the blood,
are obtained in the bath, without effort and without
exhaustion; and the system is brought into that
state which, above all, is most favourable for the
absorption of new and nutritious material. The
bath has been already applied to the training of
horses, and before long will be used in the training
of men. The Romans kept their army in health
and strength by means of the bath; and the bath
might, on the same principle, be adopted with
advantage under all those circumstances in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
bodies of men are assembled together, temporarily
or permanently, as in barracks, prisons, schools,
factories, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the gas factories and metal-smelting houses,
and probably in other trades where men are exposed
to great heat, a plan is adopted which has
considerable physiological interest, and is specially
illustrative of the nutritive capabilities of the bath.
In the retort-house, the stokers are kept for many
hours in a deluge of perspiration; the drain is consequently
very active, and it is necessary to supply
the loss occasioned by that drain by means of drink.
With this object, each man is allowed a certain
quantity of oatmeal daily: the oatmeal is served
out by the foreman, and is scalded with hot water
and made into thin gruel; this is the drink with
which the men supply the place of the perspired
fluid. They give forth, in the shape of perspiration,
water holding in solution the used and useless materials
of the frame, and they receive in return a
wholesome nutritive material. Can we wonder that
these men are perfect Athletæ in form, that they
are in the finest possible condition for labour; and
that, although working in buildings open to every
draught of cold wind, and bathed in perspiration,
they never, indeed they cannot, take cold.</p>

<p>Let us apply this lesson of the retort-house to
the ill-nourished, weakly invalid; or, better still,
to weakly, ill-conditioned children. Let us suppose
that we have the power, by an easy, pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
process, of extracting the old, the bad, the useless,
even the decayed and diseased, stuff from the blood
and from the system by means of the bath; how
simple the operation by which we could give back
in its place wholesome and nutritious material.&mdash;Where
would be atrophy and scrofula, if we had
this power?&mdash;and this power is, I believe, fast approaching,
fast coming within our reach, by means
of the Eastern Bath. We squeeze the sponge as
we will; we replenish it as we will.</p>

<p>The faculty of preventing disease, as exercised by
the skin, besides being indirect and operating on
the general health of the body, is also direct. The
skin repels the depressing effects of cold, of alternations
of temperature, of extreme dryness or moisture,
by virtue of its own healthy structure; by its intrinsic
power of generating heat; and it also repels
other causes of disease, such as animal and miasmatic
poisons, by its emunctory power, which enables
it to convey them directly out of the body. In
unwholesome states of the atmosphere, in an atmosphere
of malaria, which must necessarily pass into
the body with the inhaled air, and being in the
lungs must be absorbed by the blood, we naturally
inquire by what means we escape the morbid effects
of such malaria? The answer is:&mdash;the malaria is
conducted out of the body as rapidly as it is introduced,
by the emunctory organs&mdash;by the liver,
kidneys, and notably by the skin. If the powers
of the skin be weak, then the poisons are detained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in the blood, and disease is the result; but if the
skin be healthy and active, then they can do no
evil; and ultimately they become innocuous. Thus
the bath, by conducing to the health of the skin,
becomes a direct means of preventing disease.</p>

<p>Reasoning, on the same premisses, shows us how
the bath may be employed in the cure of disease.
We can, at our will, so far excite the emunctory
power of the skin as to make it the means of carrying
off the elements together with the seeds of disease.
If we wish to comprehend the operation
better, we have only to watch Nature's own processes.
A morbid poison is in the blood, it produces a shock
to the whole system, that shock is represented by a
chill; next to the chill succeeds a fierce fever, which
marks the furious battle waged between the poison
and the blood; then follows the perspiration, which
hurries the contending poison out of the system;
the perspiration, for the time being, is the cure.
The observation of this well known series of symptoms
suggested to the inventive mind of Mr. Urquhart
the notion, that by raising artificially, as by
the bath, the temperature of the body above fever-heat,
the proper stages of fever might be stepped
over; the chill fit would pass at once into the hot
fit, and the hot fit be resolved by perspiration.
The suggestion is worthy of mature thought.</p>

<p>Let me conclude with a brief summary of the
sanitary views which it is my aim to inculcate in
this essay.&mdash;I have endeavoured to show the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>portance
of the skin as an independent organ endowed
with sensation, circulation, powers of nutrition,
and powers of elimination. I have viewed it
in its relations to the rest of the animal economy&mdash;the
digestive organs, the heart, the lungs, and the
brain&mdash;with the purpose of showing its influence on
these organs. I have regarded it in its natural state,
as full of vigour, and possessing the properties of
healthy colour, texture, sensation, and secretion;
and in the unnatural state to which it has been
brought by the perpetual use of clothing, wherein
its colour, texture, sensation, and secretion are unhealthy,
and its power of generating heat lost. I
have explained the manner of operation of the bath
on the skin, both in its healthy and unhealthy state;
how, in the former case, it is a direct preservative
of the health of the skin, and, through the skin, of
the entire organism; and, in the latter, that it possesses
the power of restoring the skin to a state of
health: further, that the bath may be made the
means of preventing disease, and an adjuvant in its
removal when already established.</p>

<p class="ph3">RATIONAL USE OF THE BATH.</p>


<p>Admitting the importance of the bath to the
health and well-being of society, when properly
employed, it becomes our duty to consider in what
the <em>propriety</em> of its employment consists.</p>

<p>It consists in the selection of a <em>temperature</em> which
is suitable to the constitution and idiosyncrasies of
the individual; of a <em>time of day</em> most in accord
with the constitution of the body; of a period of
<em>duration</em> of the bath; of the <em>frequency</em> of repeating
it.</p>

<p>Then we have to consider certain points of detail
which come before us in the shape of objections to
the bath: for example, the apprehension of <em>taking
cold</em> after the bath; of causing disturbance of the
nutritive functions; of inducing weakness. And,
again, we may view it as a remedy against certain
affections of a spasmodic type, in which its mode of
action is so clear as to be intelligible to the unmedical
understanding; and further, we have to regard
it in its applicability to our fellow-creatures of the
four-footed class, and especially to the horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>


<h3>PROPER TEMPERATURE OF THE BATH.</h3>

<p>The history of the Bath, together with its practice,
so far as I have been able to comprehend it, both
point to the Turkish Bath, as it at present exists
in the East, as representing the proper standard of
temperature. The Turkish Bath is a mixed bath of
vapour and heat; and although we have no information
of its precise thermometric grade, yet we have
sufficient data before us to be assured that the temperature
cannot be high; for we know, on the one
hand, that watery vapour above 120° of Fahrenheit
is scalding; and, on the other hand, that the
Turkish Bath is constantly taken by travellers and
strangers; and that inconvenience resulting from
its temperature is an accident of the rarest kind;
so rare, in fact, as to be scarcely possible. Whereas,
in the high temperatures at present in use in London,
170° and 180° of dry air, disagreeable and even
dangerous symptoms are extremely common.</p>

<p>The great purpose to be arrived at, as far as temperature
is concerned, is to obtain one which shall
be agreeable to the sensations; which shall slowly
expand the pores of the skin; which <em>shall produce
gently and slowly and without effort;
so that it may be continued for an indefinite length
of time</em>. The temperature of 135° or 140° is very
agreeable to the sensations; but in me it excites a
perspiration which is too profuse; the energy of
perspiration occasions a feeling of exhaustion; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the exhaustion is succeeded by quickened action of
the heart, throbbing pulse, a sensation of faintness,
of oppression, which makes it necessary that I
should quit the Calidarium for a few minutes. It
is true that these unpleasant sensations quickly pass
off; but they are again renewed after a time, as
often as I return to the Calidarium. It is easy to
see why these disagreeable sensations occur; it is
easy to understand, that the blood, suddenly robbed
of a considerable proportion of its watery fluid, must,
for the moment, occasion a physiological change
in the whole economy. But we must do more than
explain them to our own mental satisfaction, we
must stop them; and the way to stop them is, I
believe, to use lower temperatures.</p>

<p>Again, high temperatures clearly frustrate the
purpose of the bath; by producing excessive perspiration,
they shorten the period passed in the bath;
they bring it to a too sudden and too rapid conclusion.
Profuse perspiration is an excess of
function, and excess of function cannot exist without
fatigue and consequent injury to the organ so excited;
together with more or less disturbance of the
whole economy. I have had many complaints of
the bath made to me, which have been clearly referrible
to the use of high temperatures at the beginning
of treatment; and the abuse is so plain, that I wonder,
having once occurred, it could again be repeated.</p>

<p>These remarks point to the importance of a Tepidarium
when a Tepidarium can be obtained; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
time passed in the Tepidarium may be considerable,
the body undergoing a gradual process of warming,
of softening, of perspiration; and at the end of
this process, being transferred for a few minutes
only to the Calidarium.</p>


<h3>TIME OF TAKING THE BATH.</h3>

<p>The best time for taking the Turkish Bath, and,
indeed, every form of bath, is that which is least
likely to interfere with the process of digestion;
for example, <em>before a meal</em>. But at this point it is
necessary to draw a line of distinction between the
Turkish Bath and all other kinds of bath: the
Turkish Bath abstracts from the system a proportion
of its solid constituents, more or less considerable,
while it makes only a gasiform return in the form
of oxygen. All other baths abstract little or nothing;
and therefore, in this particular, there is a
wide and important difference between them. It is
as needful to take the sea bath before a meal as it
is the Turkish Bath; but the sea bath may be taken
before breakfast, which I should in nowise advocate
in the case of the Turkish Bath. I do not mean
that, to those who can bear it and who approve of
it, the Turkish Bath might not be suitable on first
rising in the morning; but the generality of mankind
will find the most advantageous time for taking
it from three or four, to five or six hours after
meal. At that time there will be that in the
economy which nature can spare, and often with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
benefit to the health, the waste of the digestive
process, the detrita of nutrition; whereas, before
breakfast, there is or ought to be scant matter for
giving off from the blood by way of perspiration.
Invalids may take the Turkish Bath three hours
after breakfast; or three hours after the midday
meal or lunch; while the man of occupation may
advantageously devote to its rites the hour and a
half or two hours which immediately precede dinner;
and the more engaged may probably, with
equal advantage, take it in the evening, after the
dust and toil of the day are at an end, and shortly
before bedtime.</p>

<p>"Would it be no comfort, no pleasure, no benefit
to an English lady, on returning from a ball, and
before going to bed, to be able, divested of whalebone
and crinoline, and robed as an Atalanta, to
enter marble chambers with mosaic floors, and be
refreshed and purified from the toil she has undergone,
and prepared for the soft enjoyment of the
rest she seeks?"<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>


<h3>DURATION AND FREQUENCY OF THE BATH.</h3>

<p>The length of time spent in the bath must be
regulated: partly by the object to be obtained;
partly by the habits of the individual as regards
the use of the bath; partly by his strength and
powers of constitution; and partly by the temperature
of the bath. The <em>object</em> of the bather may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>be a moderate perspiration, or a thorough sweat;
he may desire simply to evaporate from his skin the
waste particles that occasion fatigue; or he may
wish to distil from his blood the morbid atomies of
rheumatism, neuralgia, or gout; he may seek for
the after enjoyment which follows upon a day's
hunting or shooting; or he may strive to gain the
health-giving results of active exercise, for a body
that has been immured in committee or in office all
the day long. I have shown, in an illustration at
p. 78, how the bath may be used for the removal of
fatigue, of hunger, the cobwebs of the brain; and
how it may be made to fortify the powers of the
muscular system and of digestion.</p>

<p>The practised bather will know when to cease the
bath, without reference to other authority than his
own sensations and experience. The weak and the
strong must be equally guided by their powers of
endurance, and all must be influenced to a greater
or less extent by the thermometer. A bath at 180°
cannot be borne for the same length of time as a
bath at 130°; and it is clear that if a protracted
bath be the object sought to be attained, the temperature
must be moderate and agreeable to the
sensations. In the baths of very high temperature
the bather is forced to retreat before a full perspiration
is accomplished, and he is therefore rendered
liable to a secondary perspiration, which chills the
skin and endangers catarrh and other local congestions,
while he is deprived of the refreshing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
exhilarating sensation which follows a properly-accomplished
bath. For him, there is no jumping
over a lamp-post, much less "the moon."</p>

<p>I have often passed an hour in the bath. Mr.
Urquhart, Mr. Holland, and Mr. Witt have spent
several consecutive hours in the bath. Mr. Rolland
lived in the bath for three days, quitting it only for
a short period at a time. To some, a quarter of an
hour in the Calidarium would be enough; while
others would prefer half or three-quarters of an
hour. The Romans indulged in the bath to so
great an excess, that it became necessary to pass a
law to restrict its use to two hours. Dr. Millingen,
Physician to the Sultan, in a letter from Constantinople,
addressed to Mr. George Witt, observes:&mdash;"If
a Moslem enters the bath for the object of a legal
ablution, half an hour is amply sufficient; if, however,
a person wishes to go through all the stages of
a complete bath, an hour, at least, or one hour and
a half, is the usual time."</p>

<p>The frequency of taking the bath must, like other
points of balneal economy, be regulated by the purpose
sought to be attained. Where maintenance of
existing health is the object, once or twice a week may
be sufficient. I can conceive the bath to be made a
part of the process known as "dressing for dinner,"
and then it may be taken as often as we dine. Medically,
its frequency of repetition must be left to
the medical man; and in every case the amount of
effect produced must regulate its repetition. "Little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and often," I would suggest as a maxim applicable
to the bath as to some others of the enjoyments of
life; and much to be preferred to the opposite
position, "seldom and much." The Romans took
the bath daily; the Mussulmans take it once a week.</p>

<p>To the natives of a country possessing a damp,
cold, and variable climate, like that of Britain,
wherein catarrhs are the scourge of the population
(such catarrhs being attributable in most cases to
checked perspiration and extreme cooling of the
surface of the body), the apprehension of cold and
catarrh from the use of the bath is a natural expectation.
But the practice of the bath proves
such an apprehension to be unfounded, and our
reason helps us to see that there is in reality no
such danger. The ordinary process of taking a
cold is as follows: we are warmed by exercise,
perhaps somewhat exhausted at the same time; the
skin is bedewed with perspiration; the perspired
fluid evaporates, producing chill; and the chill
occasions a shock to the nervous system and to the
whole economy, that results in the reaction known
as "<em>a cold</em>." But if we contrast these conditions
with those of the bath, we find that there is no
parallel between them. In the bath we perspire;
in a warm and genial temperature we abstract from
the system all the watery fluid that Nature has, at
the time, to spare; we rinse off the perspiration
with warm water; we shut up the pores by means
of cold water; we warm the body anew; we then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
rest tranquilly until every particle of moisture is
removed from the skin; and when we are thoroughly
dry, we put on dry and warm clothes. In this
process it is clear that there is not even a chink by
which a cold can approach us. If we hear of
people taking cold after the bath, we may be
assured that they have broken its laws somehow or
somewhere. The bath, properly conducted,&mdash;and
improperly conducted it is not the bath&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE BATH
CANNOT GIVE COLD</span>.</p>

<p>That which is most needful to impress upon
nations unaccustomed to the bath, is a <em>respect for
its ordinances</em>. People are apt, on their first introduction
to the bath as a new idea, either to take
alarm at the apparent severity of its processes, or
to go to the opposite extreme of treating it inconsiderately.
People require training to the bath,
as they do to other processes which are calculated
to affect the well-being of their constitution. If
they were bred to the bath from their infancy, no
training would be requisite; but as they are not,
there are very few who can go through the London
Turkish Bath in all its entirety, and as it is at
present conducted, without risk of accident of some
kind&mdash;that is, before they are properly seasoned.
I call to mind a gentleman of susceptible constitution,
whom I myself introduced to the bath: the
temperature did not exceed 135°; he felt very
little uneasiness during the process; but his liver
took offence at the inordinate and unusual industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of its coadjutor, the skin, and was many days
before its anger was appeased, the possessor being
much troubled in the meantime by the intestine
feud of his interior. But this affords no ground of
argument against the bath; it only corroborates
the views of moderation which I am endeavouring
to inculcate. Had my friend taken the bath at a
lower temperature, or reduced its duration to a
shorter period, he would have suffered no inconvenience;
and, after all, it was but the inconvenience
attendant upon the initiation of a new physiological
process.</p>

<p>A similar event occurred in the instance of
another friend, a literary man, of sedentary habits,
but thin, and not overcharged with waste humours.
The temperature of the bath was the same, but my
friend was not equal to the demand made upon his
vaporizable fluids, and the use of the bath tended
to derange his nutritive functions and lower his
powers. Here, again, it was clear that a more
moderate temperature, a slower transpiration, and
a shorter period of duration, were the natural
agents of cure. With these conditions there would
have been no strain on the circulating or nervous
system, and the bather would have enjoyed relatively
the same advantages as another abounding in
humours. If we had a choice, if we had the opportunity
of selecting subjects for the bath, we should
take them from the latter class; and these are the
persons who would derive the greatest benefits from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
its use. Another example of the abuse of the
bath was a lady who had taken twelve baths with
enjoyment and advantage: on entering the bath the
thirteenth time, the temperature was 190°, she felt
uncomfortable, and remained unwell for several
days. On the other hand, I have had the pleasure
of seeing many with whom the bath had disagreed
at first, become accustomed to it, and derive great
benefit from its regular use.</p>

<p>Non-bathers often express an alarm lest the bath
may be weakening. But the bath strengthens, it
never weakens, except, as in the instances above
narrated, it be used improperly. The idea of
weakening is suggested by the loss of fluids by
perspiration; but this loss is, as I have endeavoured
to show, a gain and not a loss. The expulsion of
watery fluids from the economy is a natural process,
necessary to our very existence, and without it we
should die. It would be very unreasonable to
regard the watery fluids expelled by the lungs, by
the skin, and by other emunctory organs, as a loss
of material necessary to the economy, or a loss which
could in any way affect the nervous and muscular
powers of the individual otherwise than beneficially&mdash;unless,
indeed, the loss be inordinate and excessive.
Is it not one of the conditions of our
healthful existence, that we should earn our bread
with the sweat of our brow? and, writhe as we may
under the verdict, we must do so, or suffer the evil
consequences of a breach of Heaven's law. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Urquhart has the following observations on this
subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is an impression that the bath is weakening.
We can test this in three ways; its effects on
those debilitated by disease, on those exhausted by
fatigue, and on those who are long exposed to it.</p>

<p>"1. In affections of the lungs and intermittent
fever, the bath is invariably had recourse to against
the debilitating nightly perspirations. The temperature
is kept low, not to increase the action of
the heart or the secretions; this danger avoided,
its effect is to subdue, by a healthy perspiration in
a waking state, the unhealthy one in sleep. No
one ever heard of any injury from the bath. The
moment a person is ailing he is hurried off to it.</p>

<p>"2. After long and severe fatigue,&mdash;that fatigue
such as we never know, successive days and nights
on horseback&mdash;the bath affords the most astonishing
relief. Having performed long journeys on horseback,
even to the extent of ninety-four hours, without
taking rest, I know by experience its effects in
the extremest cases.</p>

<p>"A Tartar having an hour to rest, prefers a bath
to sleep. He enters as if drugged with opium, and
leaves it, his senses cleared, and his strength restored
as much as if he had slept for several hours. This
is not to be attributed to the heat or moisture
alone, but to the shampooing, which in such cases
is of an extraordinary nature. The Tartar sits
down and doubles himself up; the shampooer (and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
he selects the most powerful man) then springs with
his feet on his shoulders, cracking his vertebræ;
with all his force and weight he pummels the whole
back, and then turning him on his back and face,
aided by a second shampooer, tramples on his body
and limbs; the Tartar then lays himself down for
half an hour; and perhaps, though that is not
necessary, sleeps. Well can I recal the hamâm
doors which I have entered scarcely able to drag
one limb after the other, and from which I have
sprung into my saddle again elastic as a sinew and
light as a feather."</p>

<p>Sir Alexander Burnes, in his "Travels in Bokhara,"
on the same topic observes:&mdash;"You are laid
out at full length, rubbed with a hair brush,
scrubbed, buffeted, and kicked; but it is all very
refreshing." And Anquetil gives the following
account of shampooing;&mdash;"One of the attendants
on the bath extends you upon a bench, sprinkles
you with warm water, and presses the whole body
in an admirable manner. He cracks the joints of
the fingers and of all the extremities. He then
places you upon the stomach, pinches you over the
kidneys, seizes you by the shoulders, and cracks the
spine by agitating all the vertebræ, strikes some
powerful blows over the fleshy and muscular parts,
then rubs the body with a hair-glove until he perspires,
grinds down the thick and hard skin of the
feet with pumice-stone, anoints you with soap, and
lastly, shaves you and plucks out the superfluous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
hairs. This process continues for three-quarters of
an hour, after which a man scarcely knows himself;
he feels like a new being.</p>

<p>"You will see a hammal (porter), a man living
only on rice, go out of one of those baths where he
has been pouring with that perspiration which we
think must prostrate and weaken, and take up his
load of five hundredweight, placing it unaided on
his back.</p>

<p>3. "The shampooers spend eight hours daily in the
steam; they undergo great labour there, shampooing,
perhaps, a dozen persons, and are remarkably
healthy. They enter the bath at eight years of age:
the duties of the younger portion are light, and
chiefly outside in the hall to which the bathers
retire after the bath; still, there they are from that
tender age exposed to the steam and heat, so as to
have their strength broken, if the bath were debilitating.
The best shampooer under whose hands I
have ever been, was a man whose age was given me
as ninety, and who, from eight years of age, had
been daily eight hours in the bath. This was at the
natural baths of Sophia. I might adduce in like
manner the sugar-bakers of London, who, in a temperature
not less than that of the bath, undergo
great fatigue, and are also remarkably healthy."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The medical properties</span> of the bath are based
upon its powers of altering the chemical and electrical
conditions of the organic structures of the
body and abstracting its fluids. The whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
these changes take place simultaneously, and no
doubt harmoniously; but in certain instances we
may rely upon a greater activity of one of these
processes over the other two: for example, in neuralgia,
the electrical power should preponderate; in
the destruction of miasma and poisonous ferments,
the chemical power; and in the slow removal of
accumulated morbid deposits, as in chronic gout and
rheumatism, the fluid abstracting power. The required
greater activity of one or other of these
powers would also be our guide to those physical
conditions of the bath which are calculated to
effect these objects&mdash;for example, temperature
and moisture. The temperature and degree of
moisture for the treatment of disease must be different
from that which is suitable to health. It
may be necessary to have recourse to very high
temperatures; or it may be requisite to fall below
the healthy standard. Moreover, the healthy standard
itself may require variation for different individuals
and different constitutions. The physician
is perfectly conversant with this necessity of adapting
his means to the special constitution or idiosyncrasy
of his patient.</p>

<p>One of the most important properties of the
bath is its power of preserving that balance of the
nutritive functions of the body which in its essence
is health; in other words, preserving the <em>condition</em>
of the body. The healthy condition implies an
exact equipoise of the fluids and the solids, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
muscular and the fatty tissues, of the waste and the
supply. This state of the body is normally preserved
by a proportioned amount of air, exercise or
labour, and food; but even the air, the exercise,
the labour, and the food must be apportioned, in its
kind and in its order, to the peculiar constitution
of the individual. Those who have ever had
occasion to reflect on this subject, must have felt
the difficulties which surround it, and have been
aware how extremely difficult it is to say what may
be faulty in our mode of using these necessaries of
our existence. If I were asked to select an example,
as a standard of the just equipoise of these
conditions, I should take the ploughman; intellect
at the standard of day to day existence,
moderate food, vigorous but not over-strained
labour, plenty of air, and plentiful exposure. But
who would care to accept existence on such terms
as these. Give us brain, give us mind, however
ungovernable, however preponderant its overweight
to the physical powers, however destructive
to the powers of the body. In a word, we select a
morbid condition: our meals, our air, our exercise,
our indoor and outdoor habits are all unsound; we
prefer that they should be unsound; the necessities
of our life, of our position, require that they should
be unsound. How grand, therefore, the boon that
will correct these evils without the necessity for
making any inconvenient alteration in our habits!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That Boon is the Bath.</span> The bath promotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
those changes in the blood for which fresh air is
otherwise needful. The bath gives us appetite,
and strengthens digestion. The bath serves us in
lieu of exercise. "The people who use it," writes
Mr. Urquhart, "do not require exercise for health,
and can pass from the extreme of indolence to that
of toil." How glorious a panacea for those home-loving
matrons whom no inducement can draw forth
from their <em>Lares</em> and <em>Penates</em>, to enjoy a daily wholesome
exercise, and who, as a consequence, become
large, and full, and fat, and bilious, and wheezy; and
who, in their breach of Heaven's law, lay the foundation
of heart disease. "A nation without the bath
is deprived of a large portion of the health and
inoffensive enjoyment within man's reach; it therefore
increases the value of a people to itself, and
its power as a nation over other people."<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Millingen, in the letter to Mr. George Witt,
previously referred to, makes the following interesting
remarks on the bath, and offers an opinion
of its importance, for which we were hardly prepared
in a man living in its midst, and having its
operation constantly under his eye. The prophet
is clearly no less a prophet at home than abroad:&mdash;"As
to the application of the bath in the prevention
and cure of diseases. The working classes
among the Turks, for such classes do exist, and are
as numerous and fully more hard-working than
elsewhere, know of no other means of prevention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>on feeling indisposed, but the bath. In the numerous
cases arising from sudden changes in the temperature
of the body, a copious perspiration, which
a stay of more or less duration in the Calidarium
is sure to occasion, does, in the great majority of
cases, restore the body to the equilibrium of health.
After over-exertion, again, the bath is had recourse
to. In short, it is looked upon so much in the
light of a panacea by the lower orders, that they
hardly ever dream of consulting a physician when
taken unwell. If the bath fail to cure them, nothing
else will succeed. This prevailing conviction
accounts, in a great measure, for the total absence
of dispensaries and civil hospitals, not only in this
large city, but throughout the empire. Yet I
apprehend, from the tables of mortality monthly
published, that the mortality is not greater than it
is in countries blessed with those institutions. The
higher classes, and women especially, do not, as with
us, know much about regular exercise, so that I
perfectly agree with you that, were it not for the
ample compensation afforded by the bath, they
would not enjoy the excellent health they generally
possess.</p>

<p>"You speak of the temperance of the people as
being pointed out as the principal cause of gout
being hardly known in this country. If this is
partly true, on the other hand I must remark that
intemperance of late years is much on the increase;
and, moreover, that it is carried on to an extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
which, if stated, might be looked upon as fabulous.
Yet the gout is not more prevalent, nor delirium
tremens either. This immunity I can attribute to
nothing else but to the expulsion of the alcohol
circulating in the system, by the lungs and skin,
during the stay in the bath. You wish to know
how long, on an average, does a person remain in
the bath. If a Moslem enters the bath for the
object of a legal ablution, half-an-hour is amply
sufficient; if, however, a person wishes to go through
all the stages of a complete bath, an hour, at least,
or, one hour and a half, is the usual time.</p>

<p>"I consider that you are engaged in an attempt,
which, if successful, will confer in an hygienic point
of view, a service on our countrymen as eminent as
the discovery that has immortalized the name of
Jenner.</p>

<p>"We have not here the statistical returns indispensable
to ascertain whether the medium range of
human life is above or below the average in other
countries. Instances of extraordinary longevity
are far from being uncommon. I have known, and
know yet, several individuals among the natives
more than a hundred years old."</p>

<p>My friend B&mdash;&mdash; is a man of leisure, so far as
the common necessities of life are concerned; his
worldly career has been successful; and, in gratitude
to the Giver of mercies, he has devoted the
remainder of his days to the service of God, to the
doing of all the good he can to his fellow man; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
is largely concerned in the management of public
charities of all kinds; he is regular in his habits,
active, and moderate in his diet; but, in spite of
moderation, he is fat, and as a man who despises
personal indulgence, his fat is an annoyance to him,
and an incumbrance. "What can I do to become
less bulky?" said he to me one day. "Go to the
bath," said I; "and after the bath walk to your
home in Kensington." "Impossible," said he;
"Kensington is three miles away, and I cannot
walk the length of a street without panting."
"Have faith," said I, "and do as I tell you." A
week after I received a note from B&mdash;&mdash;: "I took
the bath, as you desired me; after the bath I felt
that I could walk to Kensington, or to Richmond,
if I had chosen; but I had an appointment that
obliged me to hurry home in a cab. Yesterday I
took a second bath; I did walk home to Kensington,
no less to my own amazement than that of
my family; I ate my dinner with a relish that I had
not known for years; and after dinner, the power
and the desire to walk were so great that I could
hardly repress them." B&mdash;&mdash; has continued the
bath regularly ever since; he looks fresh and well,
and more shapely; he knows no fatigue in walking;
during the late severe winter he has required no great
coat; in the midst of the bitterest frost he walked
to the Serpentine in his shirt sleeves, with his coat
upon his arm, and his clothing is now his only incumbrance.
"I want to fit up a bath for the poor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
my neighbourhood," was his remark to me at a late
interview. "What convenience have you for the
purpose?" said I. "A capital roomy cellar," was
his answer. "Sell your wine, then," said I, "and
make a bath." "Oh! I can give away my wine,"
was his rejoinder; "those who take the bath need
no wine." Heaven's blessing on thy head, B&mdash;&mdash;;
thou art an honour to the name of <span class="smcap">Man</span>.</p>

<p>While on the subject of examples of benefit to
the health resulting from the use of the bath, I may
mention the case of a neighbour, by name Buckland,
who has put up a bath in Westmoreland-street,
Marylebone. Buckland was an upholsterer, but
being seized with rheumatic gout, lost his business
and fell into poverty. For fifteen, years he was a
cripple, and tried in vain, medical remedies, waters,
and baths, one while taking the baths of Buxton,
and another, drinking the healing waters of Wales.
He then, by good luck, fell under the influence of
Mr. Urquhart: by his advice he visited Manchester,
and took several Turkish Baths there; he then returned
to London and followed a course of baths at
Evans's in Bell Street, Edgeware Road; and in 1859
he fitted his own bath, and has managed it ever
since. He is no longer a cripple, but able to earn
own livelihood, and is an object of astonishment to
those who knew him in the days of his suffering.
The medical eye discovers that he is not thoroughly
sound yet; but the degree of recovery which has
already taken place is marvellous, and one instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
among many of the triumph of the Turkish Bath.
He has also had the good sense to discover the evil
of very high temperatures; so that he is one among
the very few to whom I can conscientiously consign
the invalid.</p>

<p>There is a painful tension of the muscles known
by the name of spasm or cramp: like other complaints,
it may be represented by a scale or ladder,
of which the lower bars are slight enough, but the
highest bring us to a knowledge of locked jaw, the
fistful spasms of Asiatic cholera, of tetanus, of
hydrophobia. Heat and moisture are the well-known
and popular remedies for this state, and the
good woman of the house is always prepared in
such cases to recommend hot salt, the tin of hot
water, hot flannels, and flannels wrung out of hot
water. These remedies are found to be useful, and,
being easy of access, are universal: a step above
these stands the hot bath, that <em>unready</em> remedy, that,
except in public establishments where it is in common
use, is scarcely attainable. For the relief of,
spasm, the hot bath stands first among our external
and simpler remedies; but miserable and wretched
indeed is the hot bath by the side of the Turkish
Bath. In the hot bath it is a perpetual struggle to
keep your balance in the water, to keep the head
from going down and the feet from coming up; the
head is kept above the water in a temperature different
from that of the body, the neck feels cold
and damp; the water is constantly varying in tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>perature;
and last of all, you are lifted out of the
half-cooled water into the chilly air, to recover your
heat in a blanket the best way you can. Perspiration
in the hot bath is no sign of the state of the
skin; the head seems to perspire, but it is probably
nothing more than the condensation of vapour on
the skin; the perspiration of the rest of the skin,
if it occur at all, is lost in the water of the bath;
and in the very outset of the perspiration, perchance,
the pores are chilled and a dangerous shock is communicated
to the whole frame. Well may Mr.
Urquhart exclaim:&mdash;"None but a Frank would
call a miserable trough of water a bath."</p>

<p>When, years ago, I prescribed for Mr. Urquhart,
while he was labouring under a frightful attack of
consecutive spasm, a hot bath, he gave me a practical
lesson of the uses of heat and moisture, by
subjecting himself to a vapour bath of such a degree
of intensity and duration as astonished all who
saw it. The bath attendant whispered me that he
had never seen such a thing before, and relieved
himself from responsibility by saying Mr. Urquhart
"would have it so." In fact, he had converted the
bath-room, for the nonce, into a Turkish Bath. But
how miserable, how puny, how inefficient is the hot
bath, or the boxed-up vapour bath, to the free, the
open, the well-ventilated and well-heated Calidarium!
The sufferer from spasm may live in the
Calidarium, he may sleep there the whole night and
the whole day; he may not only bring his muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
system down to any degree of relaxation that he
desire, but he may keep it in that condition for any
length of time, or until the disposition to spasmodic
tension has entirely passed away.</p>

<p>In a paper entitled "Thermotherapeia; the Heat
Cure: or the Treatment of Disease by Immersion
of the Body in Heated Air,"<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> I appended the following
note as a convenient popular illustration of
the action of the Turkish Bath in the relief of
muscular spasm. "How many are the instances of
spasm which come under the observation of medical
men! Spasm of the stomach, of the bowels, of the
ducts of the liver and kidneys, of the muscles.
How needless to remind my brethren of their infinite
variety; of their fearful agony; of our poverty of
means for their relief. But here, again, the Turkish
Bath cries out emphatically: 'Behold, we bring
succour!' Without going more gravely into the
matter, let us smile over the paragraph which I
have just cut out of the <cite>Cork Examiner</cite>. As physiologists,
we recognise the point and the value of
the illustration; as philosophers, we appreciate the
lesson, and become the wiser for its gift. 'One day
last week, a boy, employed in Messrs. Simpson and
Baker's biscuit factory was ascending to a loft, when
one of the workmen below called him; and in
turning his head quickly to answer the call, he got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>a crick in the neck of such severity that the head
lay almost flat on the shoulder. The poor boy was
going home in great agony, when he was met by
Mr. Hegarty, the proprietor of the City View
Turkish Bath, in the neighbourhood of Blarney,
who, on learning what was the matter with him,
sent him to take a bath. When the boy was inside
about a quarter of an hour, and perspiration had
set in, he was placed under a tepid shower-bath,
and as soon as the water commenced to fall on him,
the neck began to straighten, and in a short time
the head had recovered its natural position, to the
great delight of the poor lad, and rather to the astonishment
of the other parties in the bath, who
did not expect so speedy a cure. The boy was still
suffering from a pain in the neck; but a second
bath the next morning removed that, and he returned
to his work immediately.'</p>

<p>"What remedy so potent for that dislocation
and spasm of the fibres of the sterno-mastoid as
the relaxing warmth of the Calidarium. How
many who read this will call to mind hundreds
of cases in which its effects to the untaught mind
would be equally amazing. We may dare to balance
its merits against those of chloroform. We
may discover in it a valuable aid in the reduction of
dislocations; in the relief of strangulated hernia;
or in soothing the wasted pangs of parturition."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">APPLICATION OF THE BATH TO HORSES AND CATTLE,
FOR TRAINING, AND THE CURE OF DISEASE.</p>


<p>The Turkish Bath is not only applicable to man,
but is suitable also to animals, to the horse and the
dog, those faithful and useful friends and companions
of man; and also to his oxen, his cows, and
his sheep. In the instance of the horse and dog,
it is capable of preserving health and condition,
and preparing them by training for those feats of
strength and speed which are peculiar to those
animals. And it becomes an important and valuable
medicine in treating their diseases.</p>

<p>In employing the bath as a means of training,
we must have clearly before us the powers of the
bath, on the one hand, and the precise objects
which we wish to attain, on the other. The bath
will abstract the old material from the system, and
will thereby render the system more ready to take
up and more capable of appropriating new and
strengthening nutritious matter which may be given
to supply its place. In other words, it will do the
sweating part of the process excellently, without
fatigue, without wear and tear to the economy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
But this, although a necessary part of the process
of training, is only a part of the process. Other
means are required to direct the new nutritive
matter to the organs which especially require it&mdash;the
organs of locomotion; and the principal of these
means is exercise. The racehorse must still have
his muscles trained by exercise; the prize-fighter,
prize-runner, or prize-rower, must still pursue a systematic
course of exercise; but the exercise in both
instances is only that which is required to educate
the muscles, to give them power, precision, facility
of action, and to strengthen the breathing function;
the exercise for the abstraction of unnecessary
matter, for the removal of fat, is no longer requisite;
for that the bath will amply and sufficiently
provide.</p>

<p>My friend Mr. Goodwin, of Hampton Court, who
has had much and the best kind of experience in
the management of horses, tells me that for more
than twenty-five years he has been in the habit of
having his horses washed whenever they returned
to the stable in a state of perspiration, and with
the result that his stable was remarkable for the
health and condition of the animals. His process
was as follows:&mdash;the horses were thoroughly sponged
over with warm water; then with tepid water;
and, lastly, with cold; the water was then scraped
out of their coats with a scraper (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strigillum</i>), and
they were well wiped down with a leather. After
this they were covered with a cotton sheet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
their legs were bandaged with cotton rollers. In
fifteen or twenty minutes the sheet was raised
gradually, first at one corner, then at another, until
it was completely removed; the uncovered portion
being thoroughly wiped before the next was proceeded
with, and the process being continued until
the animal was completely dry. After this treatment,
there was no fear of any subsequent <em>breaking
out</em>, and however sharply the horses had been
worked, frequently after a run at the rate of twenty
miles an hour, they were ready and willing for a
double feed of oats.</p>

<p>How different this picture from that of the
common condition of horses under similar circumstances;
breaking out into a profuse, and often a
succession of profuse perspirations after being put
into the stable, and unable to eat their corn from
faintness and exhaustion. But how curious the
parallel with the stages of the Turkish Bath: the
exercise is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sudatorium</i>; then the operations of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lavatorium</i>; firstly, the warm affusion, then the
cold douche and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strigil</i>; and, lastly, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frigidarium</i>
and the sheet. Nay, the parallel permits
of being pushed even one stage further. My friend
W. says:&mdash;"I have no objection to see a friend in
the bath, or invite him to dinner; but not both on
the same day, for the bath makes him so hungry,
that my cook threatens to give me warning."</p>

<p>Mr. Urquhart, in a note to "The Pillars of Hercules"
observes:&mdash;"A plan has recently been suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>cessfully
adopted for drying horses after hunting.
Two men, one on each side, throw over him buckets
of water as hot as he can bear it; he is then scraped,
and rubbed with chamois leather, the head and ears
carefully dried with a rubber, and his clothing put
on. In twenty minutes he is perfectly dry, and
there is no fear of his breaking out again: the old
plan of rubbing him dry took from one to two
hours of very hard work, and he generally broke
out once or twice, and would often be found in a
profuse sweat at twelve or one o'clock at night.
The bath might be adopted for horses." "At present
we shampoo our horses and clear off the epidermis,
while we bestow no such care on our own
bodies."</p>

<p>On the application of the Turkish Bath to the
management and training of horses, the following
letter, addressed by Mr. Goodwin to the Editor of
<cite>Bell's Life</cite>, is especially important and interesting:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Editor</span>,&mdash;I hope your insertion of Mr.
Erasmus Wilson's observations upon the advantages
to be derived from the Turkish Bath may be the
means of inducing owners of horses and their
trainers to try its effects. It is obvious that in the
racing stables such an adjunct must be found of
great use to horses whose limbs are defective, and
not capable of sustaining the exercise necessary to
reduce their superfluous flesh, and also in cases
where the constitutional powers of the animals in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
preparation will not admit of their doing the strong
work required of them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wilson's remarks upon the system of washing
horses after their work allude to a practice
which was introduced, and successfully carried out,
under my direction for many years in the Royal
stables. The following narrative in relation to it
may be some testimony in its favour:&mdash;When the
late Earl of Jersey became Master of the Horse his
lordship sent for me on one occasion hastily, to express
his horror at seeing the stablemen wash a set
of horses which had just come in from a sharp run
on the Windsor road; and so great was his lordship's
prejudice to the innovation that I was afraid
I should not be able to persuade him to permit its
continuance, to give him an opportunity of observing
its effects. His lordship, however, at my earnest
request, came back to the mews in two hours' time
to look at those horses, and not only found them
quite dry and well dressed, but all of them eating
their corn with good appetites. This induced his
lordship to pay particular attention, whenever the
opportunity occurred, to the horses so treated, and
he became such a convert to this method, so new to
him, that he often brought his friends to witness
the beneficial effects of it; and, amongst others,
the late Mr. Assheton Smith came, and immediately
adopted it in his hunting stables, and, I have heard,
with great success.</p>

<p>"I know not whether jockeys have ever tried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
hot-air bath for reducing themselves; but as they
are compelled often to undergo such killing fatigue
and privation as to impair their strength and endanger
their health, they may, I hope, now that it
is brought to their notice, be persuaded to make
early trial of that which seems to offer them so
much comfort. And as Mr. Wilson remarks that
the skin of the accustomed bather perspires more
readily and freely than in those whose pores have
not been trained to its operation, jockeys may
anticipate the acquisition of some very acceptable
information.</p>

<p>"The expense of converting a loose box into a
hot-air bath is so trifling that the experiment may
be made at no great cost. London has already
many Turkish Baths for bipeds, and I hope Newmarket
will not be without one for quadrupeds.
Col. Knox has testified to its beneficial results upon
horses in Ireland; and Col. Towneley has one at
his training stables at Middleham, which, I believe,
has answered every expectation.</p>

<p>"In the treatment of disease I have often experienced
the benefit of hot air; for in former days,
when maladies in the horse were more rapid and
acute than we now usually meet with them, and
were generally ushered in by a cold shivering fit,
it was my constant practice at Carlton House
stables, when such a case occurred, to take the
horse at once into the men's kitchen, and put him
before the large fire which always kept it at a high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
temperature. By the heat, with the help of constant
friction, I generally succeeded in cutting short
the duration of the cold, clammy sweat, which is
always indicative of mischief more or less serious.
Were it for the treating of disease only, if I had a
stable of valuable horses under my care, I would
soon have also a hot-air bath.</p>

</div>

<p>I have assumed for the skin the rank of a respiratory,
of a breathing organ; and have endeavoured
to show that the cooling and drying operations
of the Frigidarium are an important part
of the bath, as their performance is associated with
the exposure of the skin to the atmosphere. Mr.
Witt urges the prolongation of this period of the
bath to as lengthened a degree as possible; and he
delights to tell his auditors, dispersed around him
like Roman senators in the Forum, and with no
other garment than a cotton scarf, variously and
negligently twined around their bodies&mdash;that this
was the period when Pliny betook himself to his
garden, and in the full light of the sun, and refreshed
by the sweet breath of the unfettered winds
of Heaven, walked in pleasant contemplation on a
terrace carpeted with a beautiful little moss of
velvet softness. We read that Sir Walter Scott
indulged in this kind of atmospheric bath; we
recognise in it the special charm and much of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
value of the river bath and the sea-shore bath; and
we are not startled when we hear from the mouth
of an advocate of the Turkish Bath, Dr. John Le
Gay Brereton, in a lecture delivered in Sheffield in
1858, that&mdash;"After leaving the hot room in
Bradford bath, bathers were in the habit, last
winter, of jumping into a bed of snow which had
been collected for the purpose. I have myself
spent the whole night in the woods at Blarney,
without any clothing save the bath-sheet, after
coming out of Dr. Barter's bath at that place. This
was after a ball, when, with several other gentlemen,
we had retreated to the bath for the sake of
refreshment from fatigue. So delightful was the
cool air, that when far away from any dwelling, we
threw aside even our sheets, to enjoy the morning
breeze at daybreak. You need not then fear exposure
to the air, after the bath; it is not so much
for the sake of <em>cooling</em> that this process is necessary,
as to keep up the action of the bath by exposing
the skin to air; it is to compel the skin to <em>breathe</em>."</p>

<p>The importance of <em>ventilating the skin</em> is illustrated
in the process of clipping and singeing, as
applied to the horse. The thickening and lengthening
of the coat of the horse in the autumn season
is a change obviously adapted to prepare the animal
for the coming severity of the winter; and however
natural in his wild state, is ill suited to his
condition as a useful and obedient servant of man.
As autumn advances, and after a few cold days, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
coat of the horse appears as if "broken up" into
plots, and the individual hairs stand out roughly,
or, in technical language, the coat "stares." Accompanying
this change in the appearance of the
skin, the animal becomes weak and languid, loses
his spirit, breaks out into sudden and abundant
perspirations upon slight exercise, and shows himself
unequal to his work. Now, the ready remedy
for this state of things is the removal of the excess
of hair, and the exposure of the skin to the action
of the atmosphere. If the coat be clipped close to
the skin or singed, or, better still, be shaven, the
animal preserves his strength and vigour, and is
equal to all the labour that may reasonably be
imposed upon him. Of the three processes, shaving
is the best, then clipping, and lastly singeing. As
to the latter, it is not quite clear whether its inferior
position in rank to the others is due to the
less complete exposure of the skin to the action of
the air, or to the sealing of the ends of the hairs by
the act of burning. It is not improbable that the
cut ends of the hair in shaving and clipping may
serve as breathing pores for the inhalation of air,
an advantage to the oxygenization of the circulation
in the skin that is lost in the contraction and
obliteration of the cells of the hair which ensues
after singeing.</p>

<p>Another curious concomitant of clipping is the
change in the colour of the coat, a change which
seems to indicate that the colour of the hair pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>duced
in the winter time is different from that of
the summer.</p>

<p>Dr. Barter, who has done so much to advance
the popularity of the bath in Ireland, and has given
much attention to farming operations, has applied
the bath to the treatment of animals suffering under
disease. The following extracts from a "Report of
the Committee appointed to inquire into the Utility
of the Turkish Bath erected by Dr. Barter, at
St. Ann's, Blarney, for the Cure of Distemper in
Cattle," have an interest peculiarly their own. Referring
to one of the patients, the reporters observe:
"We were informed she had been about an hour
and a half in, had been eight days under treatment,
and, as we were able subsequently to satisfy ourselves,
had scarcely a trace of disease about her,
and the next day was to be returned to the herd
cured. She seemed quite to enjoy her position, the
perspiration was rolling off her freely, and her
breathing was slightly quickened. She carried her
head erect, her eyes clear and healthy, and when
she was removed to the outer room to get her
douche-bath, no one could mistake the feeling of
refreshment and pleasure that the dashing of each
successive bucket of water over her seemed to give,
and when she had been slightly rubbed down she
was turned out to graze, the day being fine and
warm; but when otherwise, there is a shed close by
into which the animals are turned after leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
bath, to let them further cool and dry before being
allowed out.</p>

<p>"One circumstance is worthy of remark, which
applies to all the animals treated in the bath, and
testified to by the men in charge of the four different
baths we were shown&mdash;namely, the evident
pleasurable recollection the bath seems to leave
with them; all the different animals&mdash;horses, dogs,
cattle, and pigs&mdash;going of their own accord to the
door of the bath, and dogs particularly indicating
their anxiety by waiting at the door, whining till it
is opened, and then running in.</p>

<p>"This finished our inspection, and we now beg to
submit to your council the conclusions at which
we have arrived from the above facts, and the information
we were able to obtain in the course of
our inquiries.</p>

<p>"First, the proportion of deaths to recoveries in
the treatment of cattle distemper with the Turkish
Bath does not appear to exceed one in ten, while
the proportion that has been hitherto usual under
other forms of treatment has varied from one death
in three to one in four of the cattle attacked.</p>

<p>"Secondly, that the constitution is not impaired
by the treatment with the bath as it is by any of
the other systems with which we are at present
acquainted; and that this fact is particularly illustrated
by the rapidity with which, in every case,
the milk almost immediately returns on the animal
being relieved from the disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thirdly, that in the treatment of several of the
well-known serious diseases of the inferior animals,
its use has been attended with the most favourable
results, and particularly in all inflammatory diseases
of the internal organs.</p>

<p>"In conclusion, while we are far from thinking
that a subject of such vast importance could be
satisfactorily investigated in the very limited time
we were able to devote to it, we nevertheless
feel that we have seen and heard quite enough
to warrant us in recommending the subject to the
calm and serious investigation of those most vitally
interested in the subject."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OBSERVATIONS ON THE USE OE THE BATH.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></h2>
</div>


<p>A Bath is an aggregate of many parts, all more or less
essential in forming the whole. To single out, therefore,
any particular chamber, or any special contrivance used
therein, and to call it <em>the</em> bath, is the same as singling out
any room in a house, and calling it <em>the</em> house.</p>

<p>Bathing is a process; and that process is an elaborate
one. It comes without thought to those accustomed to
it, and no form of words can convey it to those who are
not. The bath being the practice of a cleanly and polite
people, habits of cleanliness and politeness must be observed
by those who frequent it. No code of rules and
instructions can teach the use of the bath: strangers
must learn from the attendants how they are to conduct
themselves, and not speculate upon what they do not
understand. The following injunctions, however, may
perhaps be of some service:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The bath should be taken (especially by the uninitiated)
before dinner: but if in the evening, a light repast
may be taken in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>II. Habits of cleanliness, decorum and repose are
imperative. The floors of the inner chambers of the
bath must never be trodden with shoes; these, and all
other ordinary articles of dress, are to be left in the outer
room. The bathing dress is to be strictly worn throughout,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>and never laid aside, except when the bather may be
the sole occupant of an apartment. To ensure the necessary
quiet and repose, all noisy and exciting conversation
is prohibited.</p>

<p>III. Where there is a tepid-chamber, the bather is to
remain therein for a short time, or until a gentle moisture
appears on the surface of the skin.</p>

<p>IV. He is then to proceed to the hot-chamber (having
first twisted a piece of linen around the head, in the form
of a turban), and if, at any time, the heat be found
oppressive, the head may be wetted with warm, and the
feet with cold water; and he should pass to and from a
cooler room, until the system becomes habituated to the
heat. When the skin shall hereafter acquire a more
healthy condition, and copious perspiration speedily results
from every bath, the feeling of oppression will cease.</p>

<p>V. Water may be drunk, if desired; but to drink without
the desire sometimes produces sickness.</p>

<p>VI. Shampooing (where attainable) necessarily precedes
the processes of ablution, for which object the bather
returns for a time to the tepid-chamber. In the absence
of better means, rough linen or hair gloves may be used
to remove the softened cuticle.</p>

<p>VII. From the hot-chamber he proceeds to the washing-room,
if this should form a separate apartment. After
the whole surface of the body has been well soaped and
rubbed, it is to be exposed to a shower of warm water;
and this soaping and cleansing is to be repeated as often
as may be required. In all washings care must be taken
that the same water shall never touch the body twice.</p>

<p>VIII. Immediately following the final ablution with
warm water, the whole body should be subjected for a few
seconds to a stream of cold water; or the bather may take
a plunge into a pool of cold water, where such convenience
forms a part of the bath.</p>

<p>IX. If this application of cold be long continued, or if
it take place in too cool a room, the bather should return
to the hot-chamber for a few minutes, in order that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
skin may regain its previous degree of warmth; generally,
however (after having thrown aside the wet bathing garb),
it will be sufficient to envelope the whole body quickly
with a dry sheet, and to proceed at once to the&mdash;</p>

<p>X. Cooling-room, where the recumbent posture and
perfect quietude are enjoined for a few minutes, until the
accelerated action of the heart shall have quite subsided:
the sheet is to be cast off by degrees, and its place supplied
with a fresh bath garment.</p>

<p>XI. Plenty of time is to be devoted to this important
department of the bath; the skin is to be exposed, as
much as possible, to the vivifying action of the sun and
air, and opportunity thus afforded to the newly-opened
pores to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere. Where the
cooling-room opens into a retired court, or garden, the
open air is preferable.</p>

<p>XII. Before dressing, the whole surface of the body
must be dry to the touch. If the cooling stage be hurried
over, a secondary perspiration may break out; this
may give cold, and this alone; but this is the result of
mismanagement, not of the bath. Finally; the bather
should "Dress deliberately, walk away slowly, and reflect
properly on the blessing that he has enjoyed."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
